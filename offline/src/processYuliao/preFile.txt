genesis   
 
   in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth   
  and the earth was without form  and void  and darkness  was  upon the face of the deep  and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters   
   and god said  let there be light  and there was light   
  and god saw the light  that  it was  good  and god divided the light from the darkness   
  and god called the light day  and the darkness he called night  and the evening and the morning were the first day   
   and god said  let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters  and let it divide the waters from the waters   
  and god made the firmament  and divided the waters which  were  under the firmament from the waters which  were  above the firmament  and it was so   
  and god called the firmament heaven  and the evening and the morning were the second day   
   and god said  let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place  and let the dry  land  appear  and it was so   
   and god called the dry  land  earth  and the gathering together of the waters called he seas  and god saw that  it was  good   
   and god said  let the earth bring forth grass  the herb yielding seed   and  the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind  whose seed  is  in itself  upon the earth  and it was so   
   and the earth brought forth grass   and  herb yielding seed after his kind  and the tree yielding fruit  whose seed  was  in itself  after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good   
   and the evening and the morning were the third day   
    and god said  let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night  and let them be for signs  and for seasons  and for days  and years   
   and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth  and it was so   
   and god made two great lights  the greater light to rule the day  and the lesser light to rule the night   he made  the stars also   
   and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth   
   and to rule over the day and over the night  and to divide the light from the darkness  and god saw that  it was  good   
   and the evening and the morning were the fourth day   
    and god said  let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life  and fowl  that  may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven   
   and god created great whales  and every living creature that moveth  which the waters brought forth abundantly  after their kind  and every winged fowl after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good   
   and god blessed them  saying  be fruitful  and multiply  and fill the waters in the seas  and let fowl multiply in the earth   
   and the evening and the morning were the fifth day   
    and god said  let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind  cattle  and creeping thing  and beast of the earth after his kind  and it was so   
   and god made the beast of the earth after his kind  and cattle after their kind  and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good   
    and god said  let us make man in our image  after our likeness  and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea  and over the fowl of the air  and over the cattle  and over all the earth  and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth   
   so god created man in his  own  image  in the image of god created he him  male and female created he them   
   and god blessed them  and god said unto them  be fruitful  and multiply  and replenish the earth  and subdue it  and have dominion over the fish of the sea  and over the fowl of the air  and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth   
    and god said  behold  i have given you every herb bearing seed  which  is  upon the face of all the earth  and every tree  in the which  is  the fruit of a tree yielding seed  to you it shall be for meat   
   and to every beast of the earth  and to every fowl of the air  and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth  wherein  there is  life   i have given  every green herb for meat  and it was so   
    and god saw every thing that he had made  and  behold   it was  very good  and the evening and the morning were the sixth day   
 
genesis   
 
   thus the heavens and the earth were finished  and all the host of them   
  and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made  and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made   
  and god blessed the seventh day  and sanctified it  because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made   
   these  are  the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created  in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens   
  and every plant of the field before it was in the earth  and every herb of the field before it grew  for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth  and  there was  not a man to till the ground   
  but there went up a mist from the earth  and watered the whole face of the ground   
  and the lord god formed man  of  the dust of the ground  and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life  and man became a living soul   
   and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden  and there he put the man whom he had formed   
  and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight  and good for food  the tree of life also in the midst of the garden  and the tree of knowledge of good and evil   
   and a river went out of eden to water the garden  and from thence it was parted  and became into four heads   
   the name of the first  is  pison  that  is  it which compasseth the whole land of havilah  where  there is  gold   
   and the gold of that land  is  good  there  is  bdellium and the onyx stone   
   and the name of the second river  is  gihon  the same  is  it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia   
   and the name of the third river  is  hiddekel  that  is  it which goeth toward the east of assyria  and the fourth river  is  euphrates   
   and the lord god took the man  and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it   
    and the lord god commanded the man  saying  of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat   
   but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil  thou shalt not eat of it  for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die   
    and the lord god said   it is  not good that the man should be alone  i will make him an help meet for him   
   and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field  and every fowl of the air  and brought  them  unto adam to see what he would call them  and whatsoever adam called every living creature  that  was  the name thereof   
   and adam gave names to all cattle  and to the fowl of the air  and to every beast of the field  but for adam there was not found an help meet for him   
    and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam  and he slept  and he took one of his ribs  and closed up the flesh instead thereof   
   and the rib  which the lord god had taken from man  made he a woman  and brought her unto the man   
   and adam said  this  is  now bone of my bones  and flesh of my flesh  she shall be called woman  because she was taken out of man   
   therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother  and shall cleave unto his wife  and they shall be one flesh   
   and they were both naked  the man and his wife  and were not ashamed   
genesis   
   now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made  and he said unto the woman  yea  hath god said  ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden   
  and the woman said unto the serpent  we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden   
  but of the fruit of the tree which  is  in the midst of the garden  god hath said  ye shall not eat of it  neither shall ye touch it  lest ye die   
  and the serpent said unto the woman  ye shall not surely die   
  for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof  then your eyes shall be opened  and ye shall be as gods  knowing good and evil   
   and when the woman saw that the tree  was  good for food  and that it  was  pleasant to the eyes  and a tree to be desired to make  one  wise  she took of the fruit thereof  and did eat  and gave also unto her husband with her  and he did eat   
  and the eyes of them both were opened  and they knew that they  were  naked  and they sewed fig leaves together  and made themselves aprons   
  and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day  and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden   
   and the lord god called unto adam  and said unto him  where  art  thou   
   and he said  i heard thy voice in the garden  and i was afraid  because i  was  naked  and i hid myself   
    and he said  who told thee that thou  wast  naked  hast thou eaten of the tree  whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat   
   and the man said  the woman whom thou gavest  to be  with me  she gave me of the tree  and i did eat   
   and the lord god said unto the woman  what  is  this  that  thou hast done  and the woman said  the serpent beguiled me  and i did eat   
    and the lord god said unto the serpent  because thou hast done this  thou  art  cursed above all cattle  and above every beast of the field  upon thy belly shalt thou go  and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life   
   and i will put enmity between thee and the woman  and between thy seed and her seed  it shall bruise thy head  and thou shalt bruise his heel   
    unto the woman he said  i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception  in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children  and thy desire  shall be  to thy husband  and he shall rule over thee   
    and unto adam he said  because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife  and hast eaten of the tree  of which i commanded thee  saying  thou shalt not eat of it  cursed  is  the ground for thy sake  in sorrow shalt thou eat  of  it all the days of thy life   
   thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee  and thou shalt eat the herb of the field   
   in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread  till thou return unto the ground  for out of it wast thou taken  for dust thou  art   and unto dust shalt thou return   
    and adam called his wife s name eve  because she was the mother of all living   
    unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins  and clothed them   
    and the lord god said  behold  the man is become as one of us  to know good and evil  and now  lest he put forth his hand  and take also of the tree of life  and eat  and live for ever   
   therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden  to till the ground from whence he was taken   
   so he drove out the man  and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims  and a flaming sword which turned every way  to keep the way of the tree of life   
genesis   
   and adam knew eve his wife  and she conceived  and bare cain  and said  i have gotten a man from the lord   
  and she again bare his brother abel  and abel was a keeper of sheep  but cain was a tiller of the ground   
   and in process of time it came to pass  that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord   
  and abel  he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof  and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering   
  but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect  and cain was very wroth  and his countenance fell   
   and the lord said unto cain  why art thou wroth  and why is thy countenance fallen   
  if thou doest well  shalt thou not be accepted  and if thou doest not well  sin lieth at the door  and unto thee  shall be  his desire  and thou shalt rule over him   
   and cain talked with abel his brother  and it came to pass  when they were in the field  that cain rose up against abel his brother  and slew him   
   and the lord said unto cain  where  is  abel thy brother  and he said  i know not   am  i my brother s keeper   
   and he said  what hast thou done  the voice of thy brother s blood crieth unto me from the ground   
   and now  art  thou cursed from the earth  which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother s blood from thy hand   
   when thou tillest the ground  it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength  a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth   
    and cain said unto the lord  my punishment  is  greater than i can bear   
   behold  thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth  and from thy face shall i be hid  and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth  and it shall come to pass   that  every one that findeth me shall slay me   
   and the lord said unto him  therefore whosoever slayeth cain  vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold  and the lord set a mark upon cain  lest any finding him should kill him   
    and cain went out from the presence of the lord  and dwelt in the land of nod  on the east of eden   
   and cain knew his wife  and she conceived  and bare enoch  and he builded a city  and called the name of the city  after the name of his son  enoch   
   and unto enoch was born irad  and irad begat mehujael  and mehujael begat methusael  and methusael begat lamech   
    and lamech took unto him two wives  the name of the one  was  adah  and the name of the other zillah   
   and adah bare jabal  he was the father of such as dwell in tents  and  of such as have  cattle   
   and his brother s name  was  jubal  he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ   
   and zillah  she also bare tubalcain  an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron  and the sister of tubalcain  was  naamah   
    and lamech said unto his wives  adah and zillah  hear my voice  ye wives of lamech  hearken unto my speech  for i have slain a man to my wounding  and a young man to my hurt   
   if cain shall be avenged sevenfold  truly lamech seventy and sevenfold   
    and adam knew his wife again  and she bare a son  and called his name seth  for god   said she   hath appointed me another seed instead of abel  whom cain slew   
   and to seth  to him also there was born a son  and he called his name enos  then began men to call upon the name of the lord   
genesis   
   this  is  the book of the generations of adam  in the day that god created man  in the likeness of god made he him   
  male and female created he them  and blessed them  and called their name adam  in the day when they were created   
  and adam lived an hundred and thirty years  and begat  a son  in his own likeness  after his image  and called his name seth   
  and the days of adam after he had begotten seth were eight hundred years  and he begat sons and daughters

    and lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years  and begat a son   
   and he called his name noah  saying  this  same  shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands  because of the ground which the lord hath cursed   
   and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five years  and begat sons and daughters   
   and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years  and he died   
   and noah was five hundred years old  and noah begat shem  ham  and japheth   
genesis   
   and it came to pass  when men began to multiply on the face of the earth  and daughters were born unto them   
  that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they  were  fair  and they took them wives of all which they chose   
   and the lord said  my spirit shall not always strive with man  for that he also  is  flesh  yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years   
   there were giants in the earth in those days  and also after that  when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men  and they bare  children  to them  the same  became  mighty men which  were  of old  men of renown   
  and god saw that the wickedness of man  was  great in the earth  and  that  every imagination of the thoughts of his heart  was  only evil continually   
   and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth  and it grieved him at his heart   
  and the lord said  i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth  both man  and beast  and the creeping thing  and the fowls of the air  for it repenteth me that i have made them   
   but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord   
  these  are  the generations of noah  noah was a just man  and  perfect in his generations   and  noah walked with god   
   and noah begat three sons  shem  ham  and japheth   
    the earth also was corrupt before god  and the earth was filled with violence   
   and god looked upon the earth  and  behold  it was corrupt  for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth   
    and god said unto noah  the end of all flesh is come before me  for the earth is filled with violence through them  and  behold  i will destroy them with the earth   
   make thee an ark of gopher wood  rooms shalt thou make in the ark  and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch   
   and this  is the fashion  which thou shalt make it  of   the length of the ark  shall be  three hundred cubits  the breadth of it fifty cubits  and the height of it thirty cubits   
   a window shalt thou make to the ark  and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above  and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof   with  lower  second  and third  stories  shalt thou make it   
   and  behold  i  even i  do bring a flood of waters upon the earth  to destroy all flesh  wherein  is  the breath of life  from under heaven   and  every thing that  is  in the earth shall die   
   but with thee will i establish my covenant  and thou shalt come into the ark  thou  and thy sons  and thy wife  and thy sons  wives with thee   
   and of every living thing of all flesh  two of every  sort  shalt thou bring into the ark  to keep  them  alive with thee  they shall be male and female   
   of fowls after their kind  and of cattle after their kind  of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind  two of every  sort  shall come unto thee  to keep  them  alive   
   and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten  and thou shalt gather  it  to thee  and it shall be for food for thee  and for them   
    thus did noah  according to all that god commanded him  so did he   
genesis   
   and the lord said unto noah  come thou and all thy house into the ark  for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation   
  of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens  the male and his female  and of beasts that  are  not clean by two  the male and his female   
  of fowls also of the air by sevens  the male and the female  to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth   
  for yet seven days  and i will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights  and every living substance that i have made will i destroy from off the face of the earth   
   and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him   
  and noah  was  six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth   
  and noah went in  and his sons  and his wife  and his sons  wives with him  into the ark  because of the waters of the flood   
  of clean beasts  and of beasts that  are  not clean  and of fowls  and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth   
  there went in two and two unto noah into the ark  the male and the female  as god had commanded noah   
   and it came to pass after seven days  that the waters of the flood were upon the earth   
    in the six hundredth year of noah s life  in the second month  the seventeenth day of the month  the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up  and the windows of heaven were opened   
   and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights   
    in the selfsame day entered noah  and shem  and ham  and japheth  the sons of noah  and noah s wife  and the three wives of his sons with them  into the ark   
   they  and every beast after his kind  and all the cattle after their kind  and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind  and every fowl after his kind  every bird of every sort   
   and they went in unto noah into the ark  two and two of all flesh  wherein  is  the breath of life   
   and they that went in  went in male and female of all flesh  as god had commanded him  and the lord shut him in   
    and the flood was forty days upon the earth  and the waters increased  and bare up the ark  and it was lift up above the earth   
   and the waters prevailed  and were increased greatly upon the earth  and the ark went upon the face of the waters   
   and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth  and all the high hills  that  were  under the whole heaven  were covered   
   fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail  and the mountains were covered   
    and all flesh died that moved upon the earth  both of fowl  and of cattle  and of beast  and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth  and every man   
   all in whose nostrils  was  the breath of life  of all that  was  in the dry  land   died   
   and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground  both man  and cattle  and the creeping things  and the fowl of the heaven  and they were destroyed from the earth  and noah only remained  alive   and they that  were  with him in the ark   
   and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days   
genesis   
   and god remembered noah  and every living thing  and all the cattle that  was  with him in the ark  and god made a wind to pass over the earth  and the waters asswaged   
  the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped  and the rain from heaven was restrained   
  and the waters returned from off the earth continually  and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated   
   and the ark rested in the seventh month  on the seventeenth day of the month  upon the mountains of ararat   
  and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month  in the tenth  month   on the first  day  of the month  were the tops of the mountains seen   
   and it came to pass at the end of forty days  that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made   
  and he sent forth a raven  which went forth to and fro  until the waters were dried up from off the earth   
  also he sent forth a dove from him  to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground   
  but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot  and she returned unto him into the ark  for the waters  were  on the face of the whole earth  then he put forth his hand  and took her  and pulled her in unto him into the ark   
   and he stayed yet other seven days  and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark   
   and the dove came in to him in the evening  and  lo  in her mouth  was  an olive leaf pluckt off  so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth   
   and he stayed yet other seven days  and sent forth the dove  which returned not again unto him any more   
    and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year  in the first  month   the first  day  of the month  the waters were dried up from off the earth  and noah removed the covering of the ark  and looked  and  behold  the face of the ground was dry   
   and in the second month  on the seven and twentieth day of the month  was the earth dried   
    and god spake unto noah  saying   
   go forth of the ark  thou  and thy wife  and thy sons  and thy sons  wives with thee   
   bring forth with thee every living thing that  is  with thee  of all flesh   both  of fowl  and of cattle  and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth  that they may breed abundantly in the earth  and be fruitful  and multiply upon the earth   
   and noah went forth  and his sons  and his wife  and his sons  wives with him   
   every beast  every creeping thing  and every fowl   and  whatsoever creepeth upon the earth  after their kinds  went forth out of the ark   
    and noah builded an altar unto the lord  and took of every clean beast  and of every clean fowl  and offered burnt offerings on the altar   
   and the lord smelled a sweet savour  and the lord said in his heart  i will not again curse the ground any more for man s sake  for the imagination of man s heart  is  evil from his youth  neither will i again smite any more every thing living  as i have done   
   while the earth remaineth  seedtime and harvest  and cold and heat  and summer and winter  and day and night shall not cease   
genesis   
   and god blessed noah and his sons  and said unto them  be fruitful  and multiply  and replenish the earth   
  and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth  and upon every fowl of the air  upon all that moveth  upon  the earth  and upon all the fishes of the sea  into your hand are they delivered   
  every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you  even as the green herb have i given you all things   
  but flesh with the life thereof   which is  the blood thereof  shall ye not eat   
  and surely your blood of your lives will i require  at the hand of every beast will i require it  and at the hand of man  at the hand of every man s brother will i require the life of man   
  whoso sheddeth man s blood  by man shall his blood be shed  for in the image of god made he man   
  and you  be ye fruitful  and multiply  bring forth abundantly in the earth  and multiply therein   
   and god spake unto noah  and to his sons with him  saying   
  and i  behold  i establish my covenant with you  and with your seed after you   
   and with every living creature that  is  with you  of the fowl  of the cattle  and of every beast of the earth with you  from all that go out of the ark  to every beast of the earth   
   and i will establish my covenant with you  neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood  neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth   
    and god said  this  is  the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that  is  with you  for perpetual generations   
   i do set my bow in the cloud  and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth   
   and it shall come to pass  when i bring a cloud over the earth  that the bow shall be seen in the cloud   
   and i will remember my covenant  which  is  between me and you and every living creature of all flesh  and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh   
   and the bow shall be in the cloud  and i will look upon it  that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that  is  upon the earth   
   and god said unto noah  this  is  the token of the covenant  which i have established between me and all flesh that  is  upon the earth   
    and the sons of noah  that went forth of the ark  were shem  and ham  and japheth  and ham  is  the father of canaan   
   these  are  the three sons of noah  and of them was the whole earth overspread   
   and noah began  to be  an husbandman  and he planted a vineyard   
   and he drank of the wine  and was drunken  and he was uncovered within his tent   
   and ham  the father of canaan  saw the nakedness of his father  and told his two brethren without   
   and shem and japheth took a garment  and laid  it  upon both their shoulders  and went backward  and covered the nakedness of their father  and their faces  were  backward  and they saw not their father s nakedness   
    and noah awoke from his wine  and knew what his younger son had done unto him   
   and he said  cursed  be  canaan  a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren   
   and he said  blessed  be  the lord god of shem  and canaan shall be his servant   
   god shall enlarge japheth  and he shall dwell in the tents of shem  and canaan shall be his servant   
    and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years   
   and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years  and he died   
genesis    
   now these  are  the generations of the sons of noah  shem  ham  and japheth  and unto them were sons born after the flood   
  the sons of japheth  gomer  and magog  and madai  and javan  and tubal  and meshech  and tiras   
  and the sons of gomer  ashkenaz  and riphath  and togarmah   
  and the sons of javan  elishah  and tarshish  kittim  and dodanim   
  by these were the isles of the gentiles divided in their lands  every one after his tongue  after their families  in their nations   
   and the sons of ham  cush  and mizraim  and phut  and canaan   
  and the sons of cush  seba  and havilah  and sabtah  and raamah  and sabtecha  and the sons of raamah  sheba  and dedan   
  and cush begat nimrod  he began to be a mighty one in the earth   
  he was a mighty hunter before the lord  wherefore it is said  even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord   
   and the beginning of his kingdom was babel  and erech  and accad  and calneh  in the land of shinar   
   out of that land went forth asshur  and builded nineveh  and the city rehoboth  and calah   
   and resen between nineveh and calah  the same  is  a great city   
   and mizraim begat ludim  and anamim  and lehabim  and naphtuhim   
   and pathrusim  and casluhim   out of whom came philistim   and caphtorim   
    and canaan begat sidon his firstborn  and heth   
   and the jebusite  and the amorite  and the girgasite   
   and the hivite  and the arkite  and the sinite   
   and the arvadite  and the zemarite  and the hamathite  and afterward were the families of the canaanites spread abroad   
   and the border of the canaanites was from sidon  as thou comest to gerar  unto gaza  as thou goest  unto sodom  and gomorrah  and admah  and zeboim  even unto lasha   
   these  are  the sons of ham  after their families  after their tongues  in their countries   and  in their nations   
    unto shem also  the father of all the children of eber  the brother of japheth the elder  even to him were  children  born   
   the children of shem  elam  and asshur  and arphaxad  and lud  and aram   
   and the children of aram  uz  and hul  and gether  and mash   
   and arphaxad begat salah  and salah begat eber   
   and unto eber were born two sons  the name of one  was  peleg  for in his days was the earth divided  and his brother s name  was  joktan   
   and joktan begat almodad  and sheleph  and hazarmaveth  and jerah   
   and hadoram  and uzal  and diklah   
   and obal  and abimael  and sheba   
   and ophir  and havilah  and jobab  all these  were  the sons of joktan   
   and their dwelling was from mesha  as thou goest unto sephar a mount of the east   
   these  are  the sons of shem  after their families  after their tongues  in their lands  after their nations   
   these  are  the families of the sons of noah  after their generations  in their nations  and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood   
genesis    
   and the whole earth was of one language  and of one speech   
  and it came to pass  as they journeyed from the east  that they found a plain in the land of shinar  and they dwelt there   
  and they said one to another  go to  let us make brick  and burn them throughly  and they had brick for stone  and slime had they for morter   
  and they said  go to  let us build us a city and a tower  whose top  may reach  unto heaven  and let us make us a name  lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth   
   and the lord came down to see the city and the tower  which the children of men builded   
  and the lord said  behold  the people  is  one  and they have all one language  and this they begin to do  and now nothing will be restrained from them  which they have imagined to do   
  go to  let us go down  and there confound their language  that they may not understand one another s speech   
  so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth  and they left off to build the city   
  therefore is the name of it called babel  because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth  and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth   
    these  are  the generations of shem  shem  was  an hundred years old  and begat arphaxad two years after the flood   
   and shem lived after he begat arphaxad five hundred years  and begat sons and daughters   
   and arphaxad lived five and thirty years  and begat salah   
   and arphaxad lived after he begat salah four hundred and three years  and begat sons and daughters   
   and salah lived thirty years  and begat eber   
   and salah lived after he begat eber four hundred and three years  and begat sons and daughters   
   and eber lived four and thirty years  and begat peleg   
   and eber lived after he begat peleg four hundred and thirty years  and begat sons and daughters   
   and peleg lived thirty years  and begat reu   
   and peleg lived after he begat reu two hundred and nine years  and begat sons and daughters   
   and reu lived two and thirty years  and begat serug   
   and reu lived after he begat serug two hundred and seven years  and begat sons and daughters   
   and serug lived thirty years  and begat nahor   
   and serug lived after he begat nahor two hundred years  and begat sons and daughters   
   and nahor lived nine and twenty years  and begat terah   
   and nahor lived after he begat terah an hundred and nineteen years  and begat sons and daughters   
   and terah lived seventy years  and begat abram  nahor  and haran   
    now these  are  the generations of terah  terah begat abram  nahor  and haran  and haran begat lot   
   and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity  in ur of the chaldees   
   and abram and nahor took them wives  the name of abram s wife  was  sarai  and the name of nahor s wife  milcah  the daughter of haran  the father of milcah  and the father of iscah   
   but sarai was barren  she  had  no child   
   and terah took abram his son  and lot the son of haran his son s son  and sarai his daughter in law  his son abram s wife  and they went forth with them from ur of the chaldees  to go into the land of canaan  and they came unto haran  and dwelt there   
   and the days of terah were two hundred and five years  and terah died in haran   
genesis    
   now the lord had said unto abram  get thee out of thy country  and from thy kindred  and from thy father s house  unto a land that i will shew thee   
  and i will make of thee a great nation  and i will bless thee  and make thy name great  and thou shalt be a blessing   
  and i will bless them that bless thee  and curse him that curseth thee  and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed   
   so abram departed  as the lord had spoken unto him  and lot went with him  and abram  was  seventy and five years old when he departed out of haran   
  and abram took sarai his wife  and lot his brother s son  and all their substance that they had gathered  and the souls that they had gotten in haran  and they went forth to go into the land of canaan  and into the land of canaan they came   
   and abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem  unto the plain of moreh  and the canaanite  was  then in the land   
  and the lord appeared unto abram  and said  unto thy seed will i give this land  and there builded he an altar unto the lord  who appeared unto him   
  and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel  and pitched his tent   having  bethel on the west  and hai on the east  and there he builded an altar unto the lord  and called upon the name of the lord   
  and abram journeyed  going on still toward the south   
    and there was a famine in the land  and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there  for the famine  was  grievous in the land   
   and it came to pass  when he was come near to enter into egypt  that he said unto sarai his wife  behold now  i know that thou  art  a fair woman to look upon   
   therefore it shall come to pass  when the egyptians shall see thee  that they shall say  this  is  his wife  and they will kill me  but they will save thee alive   
   say  i pray thee  thou  art  my sister  that it may be well with me for thy sake  and my soul shall live because of thee   
    and it came to pass  that  when abram was come into egypt  the egyptians beheld the woman that she  was  very fair   
   the princes also of pharaoh saw her  and commended her before pharaoh  and the woman was taken into pharaoh s house   
   and he entreated abram well for her sake  and he had sheep  and oxen  and he asses  and menservants  and maidservants  and she asses  and camels   
   and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abram s wife   
   and pharaoh called abram  and said  what  is  this  that  thou hast done unto me  why didst thou not tell me that she  was  thy wife   
   why saidst thou  she  is  my sister  so i might have taken her to me to wife  now therefore behold thy wife  take  her   and go thy way   
   and pharaoh commanded  his  men concerning him  and they sent him away  and his wife  and all that he had   
genesis    
   and abram went up out of egypt  he  and his wife  and all that he had  and lot with him  into the south   
  and abram  was  very rich in cattle  in silver  and in gold   
  and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel  unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning  between bethel and hai   
  unto the place of the altar  which he had made there at the first  and there abram called on the name of the lord   
   and lot also  which went with abram  had flocks  and herds  and tents   
  and the land was not able to bear them  that they might dwell together  for their substance was great  so that they could not dwell together   
  and there was a strife between the herdmen of abram s cattle and the herdmen of lot s cattle  and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land   
  and abram said unto lot  let there be no strife  i pray thee  between me and thee  and between my herdmen and thy herdmen  for we  be  brethren   
   is  not the whole land before thee  separate thyself  i pray thee  from me  if  thou wilt take  the left hand  then i will go to the right  or if  thou depart  to the right hand  then i will go to the left   
    and lot lifted up his eyes  and beheld all the plain of jordan  that it  was  well watered every where  before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah   even  as the garden of the lord  like the land of egypt  as thou comest unto zoar   
   then lot chose him all the plain of jordan  and lot journeyed east  and they separated themselves the one from the other   
   abram dwelled in the land of canaan  and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain  and pitched  his  tent toward sodom   
   but the men of sodom  were  wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly   
    and the lord said unto abram  after that lot was separated from him  lift up now thine eyes  and look from the place where thou art northward  and southward  and eastward  and westward   
   for all the land which thou seest  to thee will i give it  and to thy seed for ever   
   and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth  so that if a man can number the dust of the earth   then  shall thy seed also be numbered   
   arise  walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it  for i will give it unto thee   
   then abram removed  his  tent  and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre  which  is  in hebron  and built there an altar unto the lord   
genesis    
   and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar  arioch king of ellasar  chedorlaomer king of elam  and tidal king of nations   
   that these  made war with bera king of sodom  and with birsha king of gomorrah  shinab king of admah  and shemeber king of zeboiim  and the king of bela  which is zoar   
  all these were joined together in the vale of siddim  which is the salt sea   
  twelve years they served chedorlaomer  and in the thirteenth year they rebelled   
  and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer  and the kings that  were  with him  and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim  and the zuzims in ham  and the emims in shaveh kiriathaim   
  and the horites in their mount seir  unto elparan  which  is  by the wilderness   
  and they returned  and came to enmishpat  which  is  kadesh  and smote all the country of the amalekites  and also the amorites  that dwelt in hazezontamar   
  and there went out the king of sodom  and the king of gomorrah  and the king of admah  and the king of zeboiim  and the king of bela  the same  is  zoar   and they joined battle with them in the vale of siddim   
  with chedorlaomer the king of elam  and with tidal king of nations  and amraphel king of shinar  and arioch king of ellasar  four kings with five   
   and the vale of siddim  was full of  slimepits  and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled  and fell there  and they that remained fled to the mountain   
   and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah  and all their victuals  and went their way   
   and they took lot  abram s brother s son  who dwelt in sodom  and his goods  and departed   
    and there came one that had escaped  and told abram the hebrew  for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite  brother of eshcol  and brother of aner  and these  were  confederate with abram   
   and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive  he armed his trained  servants   born in his own house  three hundred and eighteen  and pursued  them  unto dan   
   and he divided himself against them  he and his servants  by night  and smote them  and pursued them unto hobah  which  is  on the left hand of damascus   
   and he brought back all the goods  and also brought again his brother lot  and his goods  and the women also  and the people   
    and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer  and of the kings that  were  with him  at the valley of shaveh  which  is  the king s dale   
   and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine  and he  was  the priest of the most high god   
   and he blessed him  and said  blessed  be  abram of the most high god  possessor of heaven and earth   
   and blessed be the most high god  which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand  and he gave him tithes of all   
    and the king of sodom said unto abram  give me the persons  and take the goods to thyself   
   and abram said to the king of sodom  i have lift up mine hand unto the lord  the most high god  the possessor of heaven and earth   
   that i will not  take  from a thread even to a shoelatchet  and that i will not take any thing that  is  thine  lest thou shouldest say  i have made abram rich   
   save only that which the young men have eaten  and the portion of the men which went with me  aner  eshcol  and mamre  let them take their portion   
genesis    
   after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision  saying  fear not  abram  i  am  thy shield   and  thy exceeding great reward   
   and abram said  lord god  what wilt thou give me  seeing i go childless  and the steward of my house  is  this eliezer of damascus   
  and abram said  behold  to me thou hast given no seed  and  lo  one born in my house is mine heir   
  and  behold  the word of the lord  came  unto him  saying  this shall not be thine heir  but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir   
  and he brought him forth abroad  and said  look now toward heaven  and tell the stars  if thou be able to number them  and he said unto him  so shall thy seed be   
  and he believed in the lord  and he counted it to him for righteousness   
   and he said unto him  i  am  the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees  to give thee this land to inherit it   
  and he said  lord god  whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it   
  and he said unto him  take me an heifer of three years old  and a she goat of three years old  and a ram of three years old  and a turtledove  and a young pigeon   
   and he took unto him all these  and divided them in the midst  and laid each piece one against another  but the birds divided he not   
   and when the fowls came down upon the carcases  abram drove them away   
    and when the sun was going down  a deep sleep fell upon abram  and  lo  an horror of great darkness fell upon him   
   and he said unto abram  know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land  that is  not theirs  and shall serve them  and they shall afflict them four hundred years   
   and also that nation  whom they shall serve  will i judge  and afterward shall they come out with great substance   
   and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace  thou shalt be buried in a good old age   
   but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again  for the iniquity of the amorites  is  not yet full   
    and it came to pass  that  when the sun went down  and it was dark  behold a smoking furnace  and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces   
   in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram  saying  unto thy seed have i given this land  from the river of egypt unto the great river  the river euphrates   
   the kenites  and the kenizzites  and the kadmonites   
   and the hittites  and the perizzites  and the rephaims   
   and the amorites  and the canaanites  and the girgashites  and the jebusites   
genesis    
   now sarai abram s wife bare him no children  and she had an handmaid  an egyptian  whose name  was  hagar   
  and sarai said unto abram  behold now  the lord hath restrained me from bearing  i pray thee  go in unto my maid  it may be that i may obtain children by her  and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai   
  and sarai abram s wife took hagar her maid the egyptian  after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan  and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife   
   and he went in unto hagar  and she conceived  and when she saw that she had conceived  her mistress was despised in her eyes   
  and sarai said unto abram  my wrong  be  upon thee  i have given my maid into thy bosom  and when she saw that she had conceived  i was despised in her eyes  the lord judge between me and thee   
  but abram said unto sarai  behold  thy maid  is  in thy hand  do to her as it pleaseth thee  and when sarai dealt hardly with her  she fled from her face   
   and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness  by the fountain in the way to shur   
  and he said  hagar  sarai s maid  whence camest thou  and whither wilt thou go  and she said  i flee from the face of my mistress sarai   
  and the angel of the lord said unto her  return to thy mistress  and submit thyself under her hands   
    and the angel of the lord said unto her  i will multiply thy seed exceedingly  that it shall not be numbered for multitude   
   and the angel of the lord said unto her  behold  thou  art  with child  and shalt bear a son  and shalt call his name ishmael  because the lord hath heard thy affliction   
   and he will be a wild man  his hand  will be  against every man  and every man s hand against him  and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren   
   and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her  thou god seest me  for she said  have i also here looked after him that seeth me   
   wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi  behold   it is  between kadesh and bered   
    and hagar bare abram a son  and abram called his son s name  which hagar bare  ishmael   
   and abram  was  fourscore and six years old  when hagar bare ishmael to abram   
genesis    
   and when abram was ninety years old and nine  the lord appeared to abram  and said unto him  i  am  the almighty god  walk before me  and be thou perfect   
  and i will make my covenant between me and thee  and will multiply thee exceedingly   
  and abram fell on his face  and god talked with him  saying   
   as for me  behold  my covenant  is  with thee  and thou shalt be a father of many nations   
  neither shall thy name any more be called abram  but thy name shall be abraham  for a father of many nations have i made thee   
  and i will make thee exceeding fruitful  and i will make nations of thee  and kings shall come out of thee   
   and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant  to be a god unto thee  and to thy seed after thee   
  and i will give unto thee  and to thy seed after thee  the land wherein thou art a stranger  all the land of canaan  for an everlasting possession  and i will be their god   
  and god said unto abraham  thou shalt keep my covenant therefore  thou  and thy seed after thee in their generations   
   this  is  my covenant  which ye shall keep  between me and you and thy seed after thee  every man child among you shall be circumcised   
   and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin  and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you   
   and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you  every man child in your generations  he that is born in the house  or bought with money of any stranger  which  is  not of thy seed   
   he that is born in thy house  and he that is bought with thy money  must needs be circumcised  and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant   
   and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised  that soul shall be cut off from his people  he hath broken my covenant   
    and god said unto abraham  as for sarai thy wife  thou shalt not call her name sarai  but sarah  shall  her name  be    
   and i will bless her  and give thee a son also of her  yea  i will bless her  and she shall be  a mother  of nations  kings of people shall be of her   
   then abraham fell upon his face  and laughed  and said in his heart  shall  a child  be born unto him that is an hundred years old  and shall sarah  that is ninety years old  bear   
   and abraham said unto god  o that ishmael might live before thee   
   and god said  sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed  and thou shalt call his name isaac  and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant   and  with his seed after him   
   and as for ishmael  i have heard thee  behold  i have blessed him  and will make him fruitful  and will multiply him exceedingly  twelve princes shall he beget  and i will make him a great nation   
   but my covenant will i establish with isaac  which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year   
   and he left off talking with him  and god went up from abraham   
    and abraham took ishmael his son  and all that were born in his house  and all that were bought with his money  every male among the men of abraham s house  and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day  as god had said unto him   
   and abraham  was  ninety years old and nine  when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin   
   and ishmael his son  was  thirteen years old  when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin   
   in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised  and ishmael his son   
   and all the men of his house  born in the house  and bought with money of the stranger  were circumcised with him   
genesis    
   and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre  and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day   
  and he lift up his eyes and looked  and  lo  three men stood by him  and when he saw  them   he ran to meet them from the tent door  and bowed himself toward the ground   
  and said  my lord  if now i have found favour in thy sight  pass not away  i pray thee  from thy servant   
  let a little water  i pray you  be fetched  and wash your feet  and rest yourselves under the tree   
  and i will fetch a morsel of bread  and comfort ye your hearts  after that ye shall pass on  for therefore are ye come to your servant  and they said  so do  as thou hast said   
  and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah  and said  make ready quickly three measures of fine meal  knead  it   and make cakes upon the hearth   
  and abraham ran unto the herd  and fetcht a calf tender and good  and gave  it  unto a young man  and he hasted to dress it   
  and he took butter  and milk  and the calf which he had dressed  and set  it  before them  and he stood by them under the tree  and they did eat   
   and they said unto him  where  is  sarah thy wife  and he said  behold  in the tent   
   and he said  i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life  and  lo  sarah thy wife shall have a son  and sarah heard  it  in the tent door  which  was  behind him   
   now abraham and sarah  were  old  and  well stricken in age   and  it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women   
   therefore sarah laughed within herself  saying  after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure  my lord being old also   
   and the lord said unto abraham  wherefore did sarah laugh  saying  shall i of a surety bear a child  which am old   
   is any thing too hard for the lord  at the time appointed i will return unto thee  according to the time of life  and sarah shall have a son   
   then sarah denied  saying  i laughed not  for she was afraid  and he said  nay  but thou didst laugh   
    and the men rose up from thence  and looked toward sodom  and abraham went with them to bring them on the way   
   and the lord said  shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do   
   seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation  and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him   
   for i know him  that he will command his children and his household after him  and they shall keep the way of the lord  to do justice and judgment  that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him   
   and the lord said  because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great  and because their sin is very grievous   
   i will go down now  and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it  which is come unto me  and if not  i will know   
   and the men turned their faces from thence  and went toward sodom  but abraham stood yet before the lord   
    and abraham drew near  and said  wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked   
   peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city  wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that  are  therein   
   that be far from thee to do after this manner  to slay the righteous with the wicked  and that the righteous should be as the wicked  that be far from thee  shall not the judge of all the earth do right   
   and the lord said  if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city  then i will spare all the place for their sakes   
   and abraham answered and said  behold now  i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord  which  am but  dust and ashes   
   peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous  wilt thou destroy all the city for  lack of  five  and he said  if i find there forty and five  i will not destroy  it    
   and he spake unto him yet again  and said  peradventure there shall be forty found there  and he said  i will not do  it  for forty s sake   
   and he said  unto him   oh let not the lord be angry  and i will speak  peradventure there shall thirty be found there  and he said  i will not do  it   if i find thirty there   
   and he said  behold now  i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord  peradventure there shall be twenty found there  and he said  i will not destroy  it  for twenty s sake   
   and he said  oh let not the lord be angry  and i will speak yet but this once  peradventure ten shall be found there  and he said  i will not destroy  it  for ten s sake   
   and the lord went his way  as soon as he had left communing with abraham  and abraham returned unto his place   
genesis    
   and there came two angels to sodom at even  and lot sat in the gate of sodom  and lot seeing  them  rose up to meet them  and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground   
  and he said  behold now  my lords  turn in  i pray you  into your servant s house  and tarry all night  and wash your feet  and ye shall rise up early  and go on your ways  and they said  nay  but we will abide in the street all night   
  and he pressed upon them greatly  and they turned in unto him  and entered into his house  and he made them a feast  and did bake unleavened bread  and they did eat   
   but before they lay down  the men of the city   even  the men of sodom  compassed the house round  both old and young  all the people from every quarter   
  and they called unto lot  and said unto him  where  are  the men which came in to thee this night  bring them out unto us  that we may know them   
  and lot went out at the door unto them  and shut the door after him   
  and said  i pray you  brethren  do not so wickedly   
  behold now  i have two daughters which have not known man  let me  i pray you  bring them out unto you  and do ye to them as  is  good in your eyes  only unto these men do nothing  for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof   
  and they said  stand back  and they said  again   this one  fellow  came in to sojourn  and he will needs be a judge  now will we deal worse with thee  than with them  and they pressed sore upon the man   even  lot  and came near to break the door   
   but the men put forth their hand  and pulled lot into the house to them  and shut to the door   
   and they smote the men that  were  at the door of the house with blindness  both small and great  so that they wearied themselves to find the door   
    and the men said unto lot  hast thou here any besides  son in law  and thy sons  and thy daughters  and whatsoever thou hast in the city  bring  them  out of this place   
   for we will destroy this place  because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the lord  and the lord hath sent us to destroy it   
   and lot went out  and spake unto his sons in law  which married his daughters  and said  up  get you out of this place  for the lord will destroy this city  but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law   
    and when the morning arose  then the angels hastened lot  saying  arise  take thy wife  and thy two daughters  which are here  lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city   
   and while he lingered  the men laid hold upon his hand  and upon the hand of his wife  and upon the hand of his two daughters  the lord being merciful unto him  and they brought him forth  and set him without the city   
   and it came to pass  when they had brought them forth abroad  that he said  escape for thy life  look not behind thee  neither stay thou in all the plain  escape to the mountain  lest thou be consumed   
   and lot said unto them  oh  not so  my lord   
   behold now  thy servant hath found grace in thy sight  and thou hast magnified thy mercy  which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life  and i cannot escape to the mountain  lest some evil take me  and i die   
   behold now  this city  is  near to flee unto  and it  is  a little one  oh  let me escape thither    is  it not a little one   and my soul shall live   
   and he said unto him  see  i have accepted thee concerning this thing also  that i will not overthrow this city  for the which thou hast spoken   
   haste thee  escape thither  for i cannot do any thing till thou be come thither  therefore the name of the city was called zoar   
   the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar   
    then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven   
   and he overthrew those cities  and all the plain  and all the inhabitants of the cities  and that which grew upon the ground   
    but his wife looked back from behind him  and she became a pillar of salt   
    and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the lord   
   and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah  and toward all the land of the plain  and beheld  and  lo  the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace   
   and it came to pass  when god destroyed the cities of the plain  that god remembered abraham  and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow  when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt   
    and lot went up out of zoar  and dwelt in the mountain  and his two daughters with him  for he feared to dwell in zoar  and he dwelt in a cave  he and his two daughters   
   and the firstborn said unto the younger  our father  is  old  and  there is  not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth   
   come  let us make our father drink wine  and we will lie with him  that we may preserve seed of our father   
   and they made their father drink wine that night  and the firstborn went in  and lay with her father  and he perceived not when she lay down  nor when she arose   
   and it came to pass on the morrow  that the firstborn said unto the younger  behold  i lay yesternight with my father  let us make him drink wine this night also  and go thou in   and  lie with him  that we may preserve seed of our father   
   and they made their father drink wine that night also  and the younger arose  and lay with him  and he perceived not when she lay down  nor when she arose   
   thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father   
   and the firstborn bare a son  and called his name moab  the same  is  the father of the moabites unto this day   
   and the younger  she also bare a son  and called his name benammi  the same  is  the father of the children of ammon unto this day   
genesis    
   and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country  and dwelled between kadesh and shur  and sojourned in gerar   
  and abraham said of sarah his wife  she  is  my sister  and abimelech king of gerar sent  and took sarah   
   but god came to abimelech in a dream by night  and said to him  behold  thou  art but  a dead man  for the woman which thou hast taken  for she  is  a man s wife   
  but abimelech had not come near her  and he said  lord  wilt thou slay also a righteous nation   
  said he not unto me  she  is  my sister  and she  even she herself said  he  is  my brother  in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this   
  and god said unto him in a dream  yea  i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart  for i also withheld thee from sinning against me  therefore suffered i thee not to touch her   
  now therefore restore the man  his  wife  for he  is  a prophet  and he shall pray for thee  and thou shalt live  and if thou restore  her  not  know thou that thou shalt surely die  thou  and all that  are  thine   
   therefore abimelech rose early in the morning  and called all his servants  and told all these things in their ears  and the men were sore afraid   
  then abimelech called abraham  and said unto him  what hast thou done unto us  and what have i offended thee  that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin  thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done   
   and abimelech said unto abraham  what sawest thou  that thou hast done this thing   
   and abraham said  because i thought  surely the fear of god  is  not in this place  and they will slay me for my wife s sake   
   and yet indeed  she is  my sister  she  is  the daughter of my father  but not the daughter of my mother  and she became my wife   
   and it came to pass  when god caused me to wander from my father s house  that i said unto her  this  is  thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me  at every place whither we shall come  say of me  he  is  my brother   
    and abimelech took sheep  and oxen  and menservants  and womenservants  and gave  them  unto abraham  and restored him sarah his wife   
   and abimelech said  behold  my land  is  before thee  dwell where it pleaseth thee   
   and unto sarah he said  behold  i have given thy brother a thousand  pieces  of silver  behold  he  is  to thee a covering of the eyes  unto all that  are  with thee  and with all  other   thus she was reproved   
   so abraham prayed unto god  and god healed abimelech  and his wife  and his maidservants  and they bare  children    
   for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech  because of sarah abraham s wife   
genesis    
   and the lord visited sarah as he had said  and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken   
  for sarah conceived  and bare abraham a son in his old age  at the set time of which god had spoken to him   
  and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him  whom sarah bare to him  isaac   
  and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old  as god had commanded him   
  and abraham was an hundred years old  when his son isaac was born unto him   
  and sarah said  god hath made me to laugh   so that  all that hear will laugh with me   
  and she said  who would have said unto abraham  that sarah should have given children suck  for i have born  him  a son in his old age   
  and the child grew  and was weaned  and abraham made a great feast the  same  day that isaac was weaned   
   and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian  which she had born unto abraham  mocking   
   wherefore she said unto abraham  cast out this bondwoman and her son  for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son   even  with isaac   
   and the thing was very grievous in abraham s sight because of his son   
   and god said unto abraham  let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad  and because of thy bondwoman  in all that sarah hath said unto thee  hearken unto her voice  for in isaac shall thy seed be called   
   and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation  because he  is  thy seed   
    and abraham rose up early in the morning  and took bread  and a bottle of water  and gave  it  unto hagar  putting  it  on her shoulder  and the child  and sent her away  and she departed  and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba   
   and the water was spent in the bottle  and she cast the child under one of the shrubs   
   and she went  and sat her down over against  him  a good way off  as it were a bowshot  for she said  let me not see the death of the child  and she sat over against  him   and lift up her voice  and wept   
   and god heard the voice of the lad  and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven  and said unto her  what aileth thee  hagar  fear not  for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he  is    
   arise  lift up the lad  and hold him in thine hand  for i will make him a great nation   
   and god opened her eyes  and she saw a well of water  and she went  and filled the bottle with water  and gave the lad drink   
   and god was with the lad  and he grew  and dwelt in the wilderness  and became an archer   
   and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran  and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt   
    and it came to pass at that time  that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto abraham  saying  god  is  with thee in all that thou doest   
   now therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with me  nor with my son  nor with my son s son   but  according to the kindness that i have done unto thee  thou shalt do unto me  and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned   
   and abraham said  i will swear   
   and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water  which abimelech s servants had violently taken away   
   and abimelech said  i wot not who hath done this thing  neither didst thou tell me  neither yet heard i  of it   but to day   
   and abraham took sheep and oxen  and gave them unto abimelech  and both of them made a covenant   
   and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves   
   and abimelech said unto abraham  what  mean  these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves   
   and he said  for  these  seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand  that they may be a witness unto me  that i have digged this well   
   wherefore he called that place beersheba  because there they sware both of them   
   thus they made a covenant at beersheba  then abimelech rose up  and phichol the chief captain of his host  and they returned into the land of the philistines   
    and  abraham  planted a grove in beersheba  and called there on the name of the lord  the everlasting god   
   and abraham sojourned in the philistines  land many days   
genesis    
   and it came to pass after these things  that god did tempt abraham  and said unto him  abraham  and he said  behold   here  i  am    
  and he said  take now thy son  thine only  son  isaac  whom thou lovest  and get thee into the land of moriah  and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of   
   and abraham rose up early in the morning  and saddled his ass  and took two of his young men with him  and isaac his son  and clave the wood for the burnt offering  and rose up  and went unto the place of which god had told him   
  then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes  and saw the place afar off   
  and abraham said unto his young men  abide ye here with the ass  and i and the lad will go yonder and worship  and come again to you   
  and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering  and laid  it  upon isaac his son  and he took the fire in his hand  and a knife  and they went both of them together   
  and isaac spake unto abraham his father  and said  my father  and he said  here  am  i  my son  and he said  behold the fire and the wood  but where  is  the lamb for a burnt offering   
  and abraham said  my son  god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering  so they went both of them together   
  and they came to the place which god had told him of  and abraham built an altar there  and laid the wood in order  and bound isaac his son  and laid him on the altar upon the wood   
   and abraham stretched forth his hand  and took the knife to slay his son   
    and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven  and said  abraham  abraham  and he said  here  am  i   
   and he said  lay not thine hand upon the lad  neither do thou any thing unto him  for now i know that thou fearest god  seeing thou hast not withheld thy son  thine only  son  from me   
   and abraham lifted up his eyes  and looked  and behold behind  him  a ram caught in a thicket by his horns  and abraham went and took the ram  and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son   
   and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh  as it is said  to  this day  in the mount of the lord it shall be seen   
    and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time   
   and said  by myself have i sworn  saith the lord  for because thou hast done this thing  and hast not withheld thy son  thine only  son    
   that in blessing i will bless thee  and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven  and as the sand which  is  upon the sea shore  and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies   
   and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed  because thou hast obeyed my voice   
   so abraham returned unto his young men  and they rose up and went together to beersheba  and abraham dwelt at beersheba   
    and it came to pass after these things  that it was told abraham  saying  behold  milcah  she hath also born children unto thy brother nahor   
   huz his firstborn  and buz his brother  and kemuel the father of aram   
   and chesed  and hazo  and pildash  and jidlaph  and bethuel   
   and bethuel begat rebekah  these eight milcah did bear to nahor  abraham s brother   
   and his concubine  whose name  was  reumah  she bare also tebah  and gaham  and thahash  and maachah   
genesis    
   and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old   these were  the years of the life of sarah   
  and sarah died in kirjatharba  the same  is  hebron in the land of canaan  and abraham came to mourn for sarah  and to weep for her   
   and abraham stood up from before his dead  and spake unto the sons of heth  saying   
  i  am  a stranger and a sojourner with you  give me a possession of a buryingplace with you  that i may bury my dead out of my sight   
  and the children of heth answered abraham  saying unto him   
  hear us  my lord  thou  art  a mighty prince among us  in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead  none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre  but that thou mayest bury thy dead   
  and abraham stood up  and bowed himself to the people of the land   even  to the children of heth   
  and he communed with them  saying  if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight  hear me  and intreat for me to ephron the son of zohar   
  that he may give me the cave of machpelah  which he hath  which  is  in the end of his field  for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you   
   and ephron dwelt among the children of heth  and ephron the hittite answered abraham in the audience of the children of heth   even  of all that went in at the gate of his city  saying   
   nay  my lord  hear me  the field give i thee  and the cave that  is  therein  i give it thee  in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee  bury thy dead   
   and abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land   
   and he spake unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land  saying  but if thou  wilt give it   i pray thee  hear me  i will give thee money for the field  take  it  of me  and i will bury my dead there   
   and ephron answered abraham  saying unto him   
   my lord  hearken unto me  the land  is worth  four hundred shekels of silver  what  is  that betwixt me and thee  bury therefore thy dead   
    and abraham hearkened unto ephron  and abraham weighed to ephron the silver  which he had named in the audience of the sons of heth  four hundred shekels of silver  current  money  with the merchant   
   and the field of ephron  which  was  in machpelah  which  was  before mamre  the field  and the cave which  was  therein  and all the trees that  were  in the field  that  were  in all the borders round about  were made sure  
   unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth  before all that went in at the gate of his city   
   and after this  abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre  the same  is  hebron in the land of canaan   
   and the field  and the cave that  is  therein  were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of heth   
genesis    
   and abraham was old   and  well stricken in age  and the lord had blessed abraham in all things   
  and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house  that ruled over all that he had  put  i pray thee  thy hand under my thigh   
  and i will make thee swear by the lord  the god of heaven  and the god of the earth  that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites  among whom i dwell   
  but thou shalt go unto my country  and to my kindred  and take a wife unto my son isaac   
  and the servant said unto him  peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land  must i needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest   
  and abraham said unto him  beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again   
  the lord god of heaven  which took me from my father s house  and from the land of my kindred  and which spake unto me  and that sware unto me  saying  unto thy seed will i give this land  he shall send his angel before thee  and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence   
  and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee  then thou shalt be clear from this my oath  only bring not my son thither again   
  and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master  and sware to him concerning that matter   
    and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master  and departed  for all the goods of his master  were  in his hand  and he arose  and went to mesopotamia  unto the city of nahor   
   and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening   even  the time that women go out to draw  water    
   and he said  o lord god of my master abraham  i pray thee  send me good speed this day  and shew kindness unto my master abraham   
   behold  i stand  here  by the well of water  and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water   
   and let it come to pass  that the damsel to whom i shall say  let down thy pitcher  i pray thee  that i may drink  and she shall say  drink  and i will give thy camels drink also   let the same be  she  that  thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac  and thereby shall i know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master   
   and it came to pass  before he had done speaking  that  behold  rebekah came out  who was born to bethuel  son of milcah  the wife of nahor  abraham s brother  with her pitcher upon her shoulder   
   and the damsel  was  very fair to look upon  a virgin  neither had any man known her  and she went down to the well  and filled her pitcher  and came up   
   and the servant ran to meet her  and said  let me  i pray thee  drink a little water of thy pitcher   
   and she said  drink  my lord  and she hasted  and let down her pitcher upon her hand  and gave him drink   
   and when she had done giving him drink  she said  i will draw  water  for thy camels also  until they have done drinking   
   and she hasted  and emptied her pitcher into the trough  and ran again unto the well to draw  water   and drew for all his camels   
   and the man wondering at her held his peace  to wit whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not   
   and it came to pass  as the camels had done drinking  that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight  and two bracelets for her hands of ten  shekels  weight of gold   
   and said  whose daughter  art  thou  tell me  i pray thee  is there room  in  thy father s house for us to lodge in   
   and she said unto him  i  am  the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah  which she bare unto nahor   
   she said moreover unto him  we have both straw and provender enough  and room to lodge in   
   and the man bowed down his head  and worshipped the lord   
   and he said  blessed  be  the lord god of my master abraham  who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth  i  being  in the way  the lord led me to the house of my master s brethren   
   and the damsel ran  and told  them of  her mother s house these things   
    and rebekah had a brother  and his name  was  laban  and laban ran out unto the man  unto the well   
   and it came to pass  when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister s hands  and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister  saying  thus spake the man unto me  that he came unto the man  and  behold  he stood by the camels at the well   
   and he said  come in  thou blessed of the lord  wherefore standest thou without  for i have prepared the house  and room for the camels   
   and the man came into the house  and he ungirded his camels  and gave straw and provender for the camels  and water to wash his feet  and the men s feet that  were  with him   
   and there was set  meat  before him to eat  but he said  i will not eat  until i have told mine errand  and he said  speak on   
   and he said  i  am  abraham s servant   
   and the lord hath blessed my master greatly  and he is become great  and he hath given him flocks  and herds  and silver  and gold  and menservants  and maidservants  and camels  and asses   
   and sarah my master s wife bare a son to my master when she was old  and unto him hath he given all that he hath   
   and my master made me swear  saying  thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites  in whose land i dwell   
   but thou shalt go unto my father s house  and to my kindred  and take a wife unto my son   
   and i said unto my master  peradventure the woman will not follow me   
   and he said unto me  the lord  before whom i walk  will send his angel with thee  and prosper thy way  and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred  and of my father s house   
   then shalt thou be clear from  this  my oath  when thou comest to my kindred  and if they give not thee  one   thou shalt be clear from my oath   
   and i came this day unto the well  and said  o lord god of my master abraham  if now thou do prosper my way which i go   
   behold  i stand by the well of water  and it shall come to pass  that when the virgin cometh forth to draw  water   and i say to her  give me  i pray thee  a little water of thy pitcher to drink   
   and she say to me  both drink thou  and i will also draw for thy camels   let  the same  be  the woman whom the lord hath appointed out for my master s son   
   and before i had done speaking in mine heart  behold  rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder  and she went down unto the well  and drew  water   and i said unto her  let me drink  i pray thee   
   and she made haste  and let down her pitcher from her  shoulder   and said  drink  and i will give thy camels drink also  so i drank  and she made the camels drink also   
   and i asked her  and said  whose daughter  art  thou  and she said  the daughter of bethuel  nahor s son  whom milcah bare unto him  and i put the earring upon her face  and the bracelets upon her hands   
   and i bowed down my head  and worshipped the lord  and blessed the lord god of my master abraham  which had led me in the right way to take my master s brother s daughter unto his son   
   and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master  tell me  and if not  tell me  that i may turn to the right hand  or to the left   
   then laban and bethuel answered and said  the thing proceedeth from the lord  we cannot speak unto thee bad or good   
   behold  rebekah  is  before thee  take  her   and go  and let her be thy master s son s wife  as the lord hath spoken   
   and it came to pass  that  when abraham s servant heard their words  he worshipped the lord   bowing himself  to the earth   
   and the servant brought forth jewels of silver  and jewels of gold  and raiment  and gave  them  to rebekah  he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things   
    and they did eat and drink  he and the men that  were  with him  and tarried all night  and they rose up in the morning  and he said  send me away unto my master   
   and her brother and her mother said  let the damsel abide with us  a few  days  at the least ten  after that she shall go   
   and he said unto them  hinder me not  seeing the lord hath prospered my way  send me away that i may go to my master   
   and they said  we will call the damsel  and enquire at her mouth   
   and they called rebekah  and said unto her  wilt thou go with this man  and she said  i will go   
   and they sent away rebekah their sister  and her nurse  and abraham s servant  and his men   
   and they blessed rebekah  and said unto her  thou  art  our sister  be thou  the mother  of thousands of millions  and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them   
   and rebekah arose  and her damsels  and they rode upon the camels  and followed the man  and the servant took rebekah  and went his way   
    and isaac came from the way of the well lahairoi  for he dwelt in the south country   
   and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide  and he lifted up his eyes  and saw  and  behold  the camels  were  coming   
   and rebekah lifted up her eyes  and when she saw isaac  she lighted off the camel   
   for she  had  said unto the servant  what man  is  this that walketh in the field to meet us  and the servant  had  said  it  is  my master  therefore she took a vail  and covered herself   
   and the servant told isaac all things that he had done   
   and isaac brought her into his mother sarah s tent  and took rebekah  and she became his wife  and he loved her  and isaac was comforted after his mother s  death    
genesis    
   then again abraham took a wife  and her name  was  keturah   
  and she bare him zimran  and jokshan  and medan  and midian  and ishbak  and shuah   
  and jokshan begat sheba  and dedan  and the sons of dedan were asshurim  and letushim  and leummim   
  and the sons of midian  ephah  and epher  and hanoch  and abida  and eldaah  all these  were  the children of keturah   
  and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac   
  but unto the sons of the concubines  which abraham had  abraham gave gifts  and sent them away from isaac his son  while he yet lived  eastward  unto the east country   
  and these  are  the days of the years of abraham s life which he lived  an hundred threescore and fifteen years   
  then abraham gave up the ghost  and died in a good old age  an old man  and full  of years   and was gathered to his people   
  and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah  in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite  which  is  before mamre   
   the field which abraham purchased of the sons of heth  there was abraham buried  and sarah his wife   
    and it came to pass after the death of abraham  that god blessed his son isaac  and isaac dwelt by the well lahairoi   
   now these  are  the generations of ishmael  abraham s son  whom hagar the egyptian  sarah s handmaid  bare unto abraham   
   and these  are  the names of the sons of ishmael  by their names  according to their generations  the firstborn of ishmael  nebajoth  and kedar  and adbeel  and mibsam   
   and mishma  and dumah  and massa   
   hadar  and tema  jetur  naphish  and kedemah   
   these  are  the sons of ishmael  and these  are  their names  by their towns  and by their castles  twelve princes according to their nations   
   and these  are  the years of the life of ishmael  an hundred and thirty and seven years  and he gave up the ghost and died  and was gathered unto his people   
   and they dwelt from havilah unto shur  that  is  before egypt  as thou goest toward assyria   and  he died in the presence of all his brethren   
    and these  are  the generations of isaac  abraham s son  abraham begat isaac   
   and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah to wife  the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram  the sister to laban the syrian   
   and isaac intreated the lord for his wife  because she  was  barren  and the lord was intreated of him  and rebekah his wife conceived   
   and the children struggled together within her  and she said  if  it be  so  why  am  i thus  and she went to enquire of the lord   
   and the lord said unto her  two nations  are  in thy womb  and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels  and  the one  people shall be stronger than  the other  people  and the elder shall serve the younger   
   and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled  behold   there were  twins in her womb   
   and the first came out red  all over like an hairy garment  and they called his name esau   
   and after that came his brother out  and his hand took hold on esau s heel  and his name was called jacob  and isaac  was  threescore years old when she bare them   
   and the boys grew  and esau was a cunning hunter  a man of the field  and jacob  was  a plain man  dwelling in tents   
   and isaac loved esau  because he did eat of  his  venison  but rebekah loved jacob   
    and jacob sod pottage  and esau came from the field  and he  was  faint   
   and esau said to jacob  feed me  i pray thee  with that same red  pottage   for i  am  faint  therefore was his name called edom   
   and jacob said  sell me this day thy birthright   
   and esau said  behold  i  am  at the point to die  and what profit shall this birthright do to me   
   and jacob said  swear to me this day  and he sware unto him  and he sold his birthright unto jacob   
   then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentiles  and he did eat and drink  and rose up  and went his way  thus esau despised  his  birthright   
genesis    
   and there was a famine in the land  beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham  and isaac went unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar   
  and the lord appeared unto him  and said  go not down into egypt  dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of   
  sojourn in this land  and i will be with thee  and will bless thee  for unto thee  and unto thy seed  i will give all these countries  and i will perform the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father   
  and i will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven  and will give unto thy seed all these countries  and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed   
  because that abraham obeyed my voice  and kept my charge  my commandments  my statutes  and my laws   
   and isaac dwelt in gerar   
  and the men of the place asked  him  of his wife  and he said  she  is  my sister  for he feared to say   she is  my wife  lest   said he   the men of the place should kill me for rebekah  because she  was  fair to look upon   
  and it came to pass  when he had been there a long time  that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window  and saw  and  behold  isaac  was  sporting with rebekah his wife   
  and abimelech called isaac  and said  behold  of a surety she  is  thy wife  and how saidst thou  she  is  my sister  and isaac said unto him  because i said  lest i die for her   
   and abimelech said  what  is  this thou hast done unto us  one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife  and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us   
   and abimelech charged all  his  people  saying  he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death   
    then isaac sowed in that land  and received in the same year an hundredfold  and the lord blessed him   
   and the man waxed great  and went forward  and grew until he became very great   
   for he had possession of flocks  and possession of herds  and great store of servants  and the philistines envied him   
   for all the wells which his father s servants had digged in the days of abraham his father  the philistines had stopped them  and filled them with earth   
   and abimelech said unto isaac  go from us  for thou art much mightier than we   
   and isaac departed thence  and pitched his tent in the valley of gerar  and dwelt there   
   and isaac digged again the wells of water  which they had digged in the days of abraham his father  for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham  and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them   
   and isaac s servants digged in the valley  and found there a well of springing water   
   and the herdmen of gerar did strive with isaac s herdmen  saying  the water  is  ours  and he called the name of the well esek  because they strove with him   
   and they digged another well  and strove for that also  and he called the name of it sitnah   
   and he removed from thence  and digged another well  and for that they strove not  and he called the name of it rehoboth  and he said  for now the lord hath made room for us  and we shall be fruitful in the land   
   and he went up from thence to beersheba   
   and the lord appeared unto him the same night  and said  i  am  the god of abraham thy father  fear not  for i  am  with thee  and will bless thee  and multiply thy seed for my servant abraham s sake   
   and he builded an altar there  and called upon the name of the lord  and pitched his tent there  and there isaac s servants digged a well   
    then abimelech went to him from gerar  and ahuzzath one of his friends  and phichol the chief captain of his army   
   and isaac said unto them  wherefore come ye to me  seeing ye hate me  and have sent me away from you   
   and they said  we saw certainly that the lord was with thee  and we said  let there be now an oath betwixt us   even  betwixt us and thee  and let us make a covenant with thee   
   that thou wilt do us no hurt  as we have not touched thee  and as we have done unto thee nothing but good  and have sent thee away in peace  thou  art  now the blessed of the lord   
   and he made them a feast  and they did eat and drink   
   and they rose up betimes in the morning  and sware one to another  and isaac sent them away  and they departed from him in peace   
   and it came to pass the same day  that isaac s servants came  and told him concerning the well which they had digged  and said unto him  we have found water   
   and he called it shebah  therefore the name of the city  is  beersheba unto this day   
    and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite  and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite   
   which were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah   
genesis    
   and it came to pass  that when isaac was old  and his eyes were dim  so that he could not see  he called esau his eldest son  and said unto him  my son  and he said unto him  behold   here am  i   
  and he said  behold now  i am old  i know not the day of my death   
  now therefore take  i pray thee  thy weapons  thy quiver and thy bow  and go out to the field  and take me  some  venison   
  and make me savoury meat  such as i love  and bring  it  to me  that i may eat  that my soul may bless thee before i die   
  and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son  and esau went to the field to hunt  for  venison   and  to bring  it    
   and rebekah spake unto jacob her son  saying  behold  i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother  saying   
  bring me venison  and make me savoury meat  that i may eat  and bless thee before the lord before my death   
  now therefore  my son  obey my voice according to that which i command thee   
  go now to the flock  and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats  and i will make them savoury meat for thy father  such as he loveth   
   and thou shalt bring  it  to thy father  that he may eat  and that he may bless thee before his death   
   and jacob said to rebekah his mother  behold  esau my brother  is  a hairy man  and i  am  a smooth man   
   my father peradventure will feel me  and i shall seem to him as a deceiver  and i shall bring a curse upon me  and not a blessing   
   and his mother said unto him  upon me  be  thy curse  my son  only obey my voice  and go fetch me  them    
   and he went  and fetched  and brought  them  to his mother  and his mother made savoury meat  such as his father loved   
   and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau  which  were  with her in the house  and put them upon jacob her younger son   
   and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands  and upon the smooth of his neck   
   and she gave the savoury meat and the bread  which she had prepared  into the hand of her son jacob   
    and he came unto his father  and said  my father  and he said  here  am  i  who  art  thou  my son   
   and jacob said unto his father  i  am  esau thy firstborn  i have done according as thou badest me  arise  i pray thee  sit and eat of my venison  that thy soul may bless me   
   and isaac said unto his son  how  is it  that thou hast found  it  so quickly  my son  and he said  because the lord thy god brought  it  to me   
   and isaac said unto jacob  come near  i pray thee  that i may feel thee  my son  whether thou  be  my very son esau or not   
   and jacob went near unto isaac his father  and he felt him  and said  the voice  is  jacob s voice  but the hands  are  the hands of esau   
   and he discerned him not  because his hands were hairy  as his brother esau s hands  so he blessed him   
   and he said   art  thou my very son esau  and he said  i  am    
   and he said  bring  it  near to me  and i will eat of my son s venison  that my soul may bless thee  and he brought  it  near to him  and he did eat  and he brought him wine  and he drank   
   and his father isaac said unto him  come near now  and kiss me  my son   
   and he came near  and kissed him  and he smelled the smell of his raiment  and blessed him  and said  see  the smell of my son  is  as the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed   
   therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven  and the fatness of the earth  and plenty of corn and wine   
   let people serve thee  and nations bow down to thee  be lord over thy brethren  and let thy mother s sons bow down to thee  cursed  be  every one that curseth thee  and blessed  be  he that blesseth thee   
    and it came to pass  as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob  and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father  that esau his brother came in from his hunting   
   and he also had made savoury meat  and brought it unto his father  and said unto his father  let my father arise  and eat of his son s venison  that thy soul may bless me   
   and isaac his father said unto him  who  art  thou  and he said  i  am  thy son  thy firstborn esau   
   and isaac trembled very exceedingly  and said  who  where  is  he that hath taken venison  and brought  it  me  and i have eaten of all before thou camest  and have blessed him  yea   and  he shall be blessed   
   and when esau heard the words of his father  he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry  and said unto his father  bless me   even  me also  o my father   
   and he said  thy brother came with subtilty  and hath taken away thy blessing   
   and he said  is not he rightly named jacob  for he hath supplanted me these two times  he took away my birthright  and  behold  now he hath taken away my blessing  and he said  hast thou not reserved a blessing for me   
   and isaac answered and said unto esau  behold  i have made him thy lord  and all his brethren have i given to him for servants  and with corn and wine have i sustained him  and what shall i do now unto thee  my son   
   and esau said unto his father  hast thou but one blessing  my father  bless me   even  me also  o my father  and esau lifted up his voice  and wept   
   and isaac his father answered and said unto him  behold  thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth  and of the dew of heaven from above   
   and by thy sword shalt thou live  and shalt serve thy brother  and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion  that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck   
    and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him  and esau said in his heart  the days of mourning for my father are at hand  then will i slay my brother jacob   
   and these words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah  and she sent and called jacob her younger son  and said unto him  behold  thy brother esau  as touching thee  doth comfort himself   purposing  to kill thee   
   now therefore  my son  obey my voice  and arise  flee thou to laban my brother to haran   
   and tarry with him a few days  until thy brother s fury turn away   
   until thy brother s anger turn away from thee  and he forget  that  which thou hast done to him  then i will send  and fetch thee from thence  why should i be deprived also of you both in one day   
   and rebekah said to isaac  i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth  if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth  such as these  which are  of the daughters of the land  what good shall my life do me   
genesis    
   and isaac called jacob  and blessed him  and charged him  and said unto him  thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan   
  arise  go to padanaram  to the house of bethuel thy mother s father  and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of laban thy mother s brother   
  and god almighty bless thee  and make thee fruitful  and multiply thee  that thou mayest be a multitude of people   
  and give thee the blessing of abraham  to thee  and to thy seed with thee  that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger  which god gave unto abraham   
  and isaac sent away jacob  and he went to padanaram unto laban  son of bethuel the syrian  the brother of rebekah  jacob s and esau s mother   
   when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob  and sent him away to padanaram  to take him a wife from thence  and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge  saying  thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan   
  and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother  and was gone to padanaram   
  and esau seeing that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father   
  then went esau unto ishmael  and took unto the wives which he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abraham s son  the sister of nebajoth  to be his wife   
    and jacob went out from beersheba  and went toward haran   
   and he lighted upon a certain place  and tarried there all night  because the sun was set  and he took of the stones of that place  and put  them for  his pillows  and lay down in that place to sleep   
   and he dreamed  and behold a ladder set up on the earth  and the top of it reached to heaven  and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it   
   and  behold  the lord stood above it  and said  i  am  the lord god of abraham thy father  and the god of isaac  the land whereon thou liest  to thee will i give it  and to thy seed   
   and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth  and thou shalt spread abroad to the west  and to the east  and to the north  and to the south  and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed   
   and  behold  i  am  with thee  and will keep thee in all  places  whither thou goest  and will bring thee again into this land  for i will not leave thee  until i have done  that  which i have spoken to thee of   
    and jacob awaked out of his sleep  and he said  surely the lord is in this place  and i knew  it  not   
   and he was afraid  and said  how dreadful  is  this place  this  is  none other but the house of god  and this  is  the gate of heaven   
   and jacob rose up early in the morning  and took the stone that he had put  for  his pillows  and set it up  for  a pillar  and poured oil upon the top of it   
   and he called the name of that place bethel  but the name of that city  was called  luz at the first   
   and jacob vowed a vow  saying  if god will be with me  and will keep me in this way that i go  and will give me bread to eat  and raiment to put on   
   so that i come again to my father s house in peace  then shall the lord be my god   
   and this stone  which i have set  for  a pillar  shall be god s house  and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee   
genesis    
   then jacob went on his journey  and came into the land of the people of the east   
  and he looked  and behold a well in the field  and  lo  there  were  three flocks of sheep lying by it  for out of that well they watered the flocks  and a great stone  was  upon the well s mouth   
  and thither were all the flocks gathered  and they rolled the stone from the well s mouth  and watered the sheep  and put the stone again upon the well s mouth in his place   
  and jacob said unto them  my brethren  whence  be  ye  and they said  of haran  are  we   
  and he said unto them  know ye laban the son of nahor  and they said  we know  him    
  and he said unto them   is  he well  and they said   he is  well  and  behold  rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep   
  and he said  lo   it is  yet high day  neither  is it  time that the cattle should be gathered together  water ye the sheep  and go  and  feed  them    
  and they said  we cannot  until all the flocks be gathered together  and  till  they roll the stone from the well s mouth  then we water the sheep   
   and while he yet spake with them  rachel came with her father s sheep  for she kept them   
   and it came to pass  when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mother s brother  and the sheep of laban his mother s brother  that jacob went near  and rolled the stone from the well s mouth  and watered the flock of laban his mother s brother   
   and jacob kissed rachel  and lifted up his voice  and wept   
   and jacob told rachel that he  was  her father s brother  and that he  was  rebekah s son  and she ran and told her father   
   and it came to pass  when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sister s son  that he ran to meet him  and embraced him  and kissed him  and brought him to his house  and he told laban all these things   
   and laban said to him  surely thou  art  my bone and my flesh  and he abode with him the space of a month   
    and laban said unto jacob  because thou  art  my brother  shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought  tell me  what  shall  thy wages  be    
   and laban had two daughters  the name of the elder  was  leah  and the name of the younger  was  rachel   
   leah  was  tender eyed  but rachel was beautiful and well favoured   
   and jacob loved rachel  and said  i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter   
   and laban said   it is  better that i give her to thee  than that i should give her to another man  abide with me   
   and jacob served seven years for rachel  and they seemed unto him  but  a few days  for the love he had to her   
   and jacob said unto laban  give  me  my wife  for my days are fulfilled  that i may go in unto her   
   and laban gathered together all the men of the place  and made a feast   
   and it came to pass in the evening  that he took leah his daughter  and brought her to him  and he went in unto her   
   and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid  for  an handmaid   
   and it came to pass  that in the morning  behold  it  was  leah  and he said to laban  what  is  this thou hast done unto me  did not i serve with thee for rachel  wherefore then hast thou beguiled me   
   and laban said  it must not be so done in our country  to give the younger before the firstborn   
   fulfil her week  and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years   
   and jacob did so  and fulfilled her week  and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife also   
   and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her maid   
   and he went in also unto rachel  and he loved also rachel more than leah  and served with him yet seven other years   
    and when the lord saw that leah  was  hated  he opened her womb  but rachel  was  barren   
   and leah conceived  and bare a son  and she called his name reuben  for she said  surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction  now therefore my husband will love me   
   and she conceived again  and bare a son  and said  because the lord hath heard that i  was  hated  he hath therefore given me this  son  also  and she called his name simeon   
   and she conceived again  and bare a son  and said  now this time will my husband be joined unto me  because i have born him three sons  therefore was his name called levi   
   and she conceived again  and bare a son  and she said  now will i praise the lord  therefore she called his name judah  and left bearing   
genesis    
   and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children  rachel envied her sister  and said unto jacob  give me children  or else i die   
  and jacob s anger was kindled against rachel  and he said   am  i in god s stead  who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb   
  and she said  behold my maid bilhah  go in unto her  and she shall bear upon my knees  that i may also have children by her   
  and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife  and jacob went in unto her   
  and bilhah conceived  and bare jacob a son   
  and rachel said  god hath judged me  and hath also heard my voice  and hath given me a son  therefore called she his name dan   
  and bilhah rachel s maid conceived again  and bare jacob a second son   
  and rachel said  with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister  and i have prevailed  and she called his name naphtali   
  when leah saw that she had left bearing  she took zilpah her maid  and gave her jacob to wife   
   and zilpah leah s maid bare jacob a son   
   and leah said  a troop cometh  and she called his name gad   
   and zilpah leah s maid bare jacob a second son   
   and leah said  happy am i  for the daughters will call me blessed  and she called his name asher   
    and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest  and found mandrakes in the field  and brought them unto his mother leah  then rachel said to leah  give me  i pray thee  of thy son s mandrakes   
   and she said unto her   is it  a small matter that thou hast taken my husband  and wouldest thou take away my son s mandrakes also  and rachel said  therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son s mandrakes   
   and jacob came out of the field in the evening  and leah went out to meet him  and said  thou must come in unto me  for surely i have hired thee with my son s mandrakes  and he lay with her that night   
   and god hearkened unto leah  and she conceived  and bare jacob the fifth son   
   and leah said  god hath given me my hire  because i have given my maiden to my husband  and she called his name issachar   
   and leah conceived again  and bare jacob the sixth son   
   and leah said  god hath endued me  with  a good dowry  now will my husband dwell with me  because i have born him six sons  and she called his name zebulun   
   and afterwards she bare a daughter  and called her name dinah   
   and god remembered rachel  and god hearkened to her  and opened her womb   
   and she conceived  and bare a son  and said  god hath taken away my reproach   
   and she called his name joseph  and said  the lord shall add to me another son   
    and it came to pass  when rachel had born joseph  that jacob said unto laban  send me away  that i may go unto mine own place  and to my country   
   give  me  my wives and my children  for whom i have served thee  and let me go  for thou knowest my service which i have done thee   
   and laban said unto him  i pray thee  if i have found favour in thine eyes   tarry  for  i have learned by experience that the lord hath blessed me for thy sake   
   and he said  appoint me thy wages  and i will give  it    
   and he said unto him  thou knowest how i have served thee  and how thy cattle was with me   
   for  it was  little which thou hadst before i  came   and it is  now  increased unto a multitude  and the lord hath blessed thee since my coming  and now when shall i provide for mine own house also   
   and he said  what shall i give thee  and jacob said  thou shalt not give me any thing  if thou wilt do this thing for me  i will again feed  and  keep thy flock   
   i will pass through all thy flock to day  removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle  and all the brown cattle among the sheep  and the spotted and speckled among the goats  and  of such  shall be my hire   
   so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come  when it shall come for my hire before thy face  every one that  is  not speckled and spotted among the goats  and brown among the sheep  that shall be counted stolen with me   
   and laban said  behold  i would it might be according to thy word   
   and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted  and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted   and  every one that had  some  white in it  and all the brown among the sheep  and gave  them  into the hand of his sons   
   and he set three days  journey betwixt himself and jacob  and jacob fed the rest of laban s flocks   
    and jacob took him rods of green poplar  and of the hazel and chesnut tree  and pilled white strakes in them  and made the white appear which  was  in the rods   
   and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink  that they should conceive when they came to drink   
   and the flocks conceived before the rods  and brought forth cattle ringstraked  speckled  and spotted   
   and jacob did separate the lambs  and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked  and all the brown in the flock of laban  and he put his own flocks by themselves  and put them not unto laban s cattle   
   and it came to pass  whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive  that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters  that they might conceive among the rods   
   but when the cattle were feeble  he put  them  not in  so the feebler were laban s  and the stronger jacob s   
   and the man increased exceedingly  and had much cattle  and maidservants  and menservants  and camels  and asses   
genesis    
   and he heard the words of laban s sons  saying  jacob hath taken away all that  was  our father s  and of  that  which  was  our father s hath he gotten all this glory   
  and jacob beheld the countenance of laban  and  behold  it  was  not toward him as before   
  and the lord said unto jacob  return unto the land of thy fathers  and to thy kindred  and i will be with thee   
  and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock   
  and said unto them  i see your father s countenance  that it  is  not toward me as before  but the god of my father hath been with me   
  and ye know that with all my power i have served your father   
  and your father hath deceived me  and changed my wages ten times  but god suffered him not to hurt me   
  if he said thus  the speckled shall be thy wages  then all the cattle bare speckled  and if he said thus  the ringstraked shall be thy hire  then bare all the cattle ringstraked   
  thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father  and given  them  to me   
   and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived  that i lifted up mine eyes  and saw in a dream  and  behold  the rams which leaped upon the cattle  were  ringstraked  speckled  and grisled   
   and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream   saying   jacob  and i said  here  am  i   
   and he said  lift up now thine eyes  and see  all the rams which leap upon the cattle  are  ringstraked  speckled  and grisled  for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee   
   i  am  the god of bethel  where thou anointedst the pillar   and  where thou vowedst a vow unto me  now arise  get thee out from this land  and return unto the land of thy kindred   
   and rachel and leah answered and said unto him   is there  yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father s house   
   are we not counted of him strangers  for he hath sold us  and hath quite devoured also our money   
   for all the riches which god hath taken from our father  that  is  ours  and our children s  now then  whatsoever god hath said unto thee  do   
    then jacob rose up  and set his sons and his wives upon camels   
   and he carried away all his cattle  and all his goods which he had gotten  the cattle of his getting  which he had gotten in padanaram  for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan   
   and laban went to shear his sheep  and rachel had stolen the images that  were  her father s   
   and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian  in that he told him not that he fled   
   so he fled with all that he had  and he rose up  and passed over the river  and set his face  toward  the mount gilead   
   and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled   
   and he took his brethren with him  and pursued after him seven days  journey  and they overtook him in the mount gilead   
   and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night  and said unto him  take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad   
    then laban overtook jacob  now jacob had pitched his tent in the mount  and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead   
   and laban said to jacob  what hast thou done  that thou hast stolen away unawares to me  and carried away my daughters  as captives  taken  with the sword   
   wherefore didst thou flee away secretly  and steal away from me  and didst not tell me  that i might have sent thee away with mirth  and with songs  with tabret  and with harp   
   and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters  thou hast now done foolishly in  so  doing   
   it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt  but the god of your father spake unto me yesternight  saying  take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad   
   and now   though  thou wouldest needs be gone  because thou sore longedst after thy father s house   yet  wherefore hast thou stolen my gods   
   and jacob answered and said to laban  because i was afraid  for i said  peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me   
   with whomsoever thou findest thy gods  let him not live  before our brethren discern thou what  is  thine with me  and take  it  to thee  for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them   
   and laban went into jacob s tent  and into leah s tent  and into the two maidservants  tents  but he found  them  not  then went he out of leah s tent  and entered into rachel s tent   
   now rachel had taken the images  and put them in the camel s furniture  and sat upon them  and laban searched all the tent  but found  them  not   
   and she said to her father  let it not displease my lord that i cannot rise up before thee  for the custom of women  is  upon me  and he searched  but found not the images   
    and jacob was wroth  and chode with laban  and jacob answered and said to laban  what  is  my trespass  what  is  my sin  that thou hast so hotly pursued after me   
   whereas thou hast searched all my stuff  what hast thou found of all thy household stuff  set  it  here before my brethren and thy brethren  that they may judge betwixt us both   
   this twenty years  have  i  been  with thee  thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young  and the rams of thy flock have i not eaten   
   that which was torn  of beasts  i brought not unto thee  i bare the loss of it  of my hand didst thou require it   whether  stolen by day  or stolen by night   
    thus  i was  in the day the drought consumed me  and the frost by night  and my sleep departed from mine eyes   
   thus have i been twenty years in thy house  i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters  and six years for thy cattle  and thou hast changed my wages ten times   
   except the god of my father  the god of abraham  and the fear of isaac  had been with me  surely thou hadst sent me away now empty  god hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands  and rebuked  thee  yesternight   
    and laban answered and said unto jacob   these  daughters  are  my daughters  and  these  children  are  my children  and  these  cattle  are  my cattle  and all that thou seest  is  mine  and what can i do this day unto these my daughters  or unto their children which they have born   
   now therefore come thou  let us make a covenant  i and thou  and let it be for a witness between me and thee   
   and jacob took a stone  and set it up  for  a pillar   
   and jacob said unto his brethren  gather stones  and they took stones  and made an heap  and they did eat there upon the heap   
   and laban called it jegarsahadutha  but jacob called it galeed   
   and laban said  this heap  is  a witness between me and thee this day  therefore was the name of it called galeed   
   and mizpah  for he said  the lord watch between me and thee  when we are absent one from another   
   if thou shalt afflict my daughters  or if thou shalt take  other  wives beside my daughters  no man  is  with us  see  god  is  witness betwixt me and thee   
   and laban said to jacob  behold this heap  and behold  this  pillar  which i have cast betwixt me and thee   
   this heap  be  witness  and  this  pillar  be  witness  that i will not pass over this heap to thee  and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me  for harm   
   the god of abraham  and the god of nahor  the god of their father  judge betwixt us  and jacob sware by the fear of his father isaac   
   then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount  and called his brethren to eat bread  and they did eat bread  and tarried all night in the mount   
   and early in the morning laban rose up  and kissed his sons and his daughters  and blessed them  and laban departed  and returned unto his place   
genesis    
   and jacob went on his way  and the angels of god met him   
  and when jacob saw them  he said  this  is  god s host  and he called the name of that place mahanaim   
   and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir  the country of edom   
  and he commanded them  saying  thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau  thy servant jacob saith thus  i have sojourned with laban  and stayed there until now   
  and i have oxen  and asses  flocks  and menservants  and womenservants  and i have sent to tell my lord  that i may find grace in thy sight   
  and the messengers returned to jacob  saying  we came to thy brother esau  and also he cometh to meet thee  and four hundred men with him   
  then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed  and he divided the people that  was  with him  and the flocks  and herds  and the camels  into two bands   
  and said  if esau come to the one company  and smite it  then the other company which is left shall escape   
   and jacob said  o god of my father abraham  and god of my father isaac  the lord which saidst unto me  return unto thy country  and to thy kindred  and i will deal well with thee   
   i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies  and of all the truth  which thou hast shewed unto thy servant  for with my staff i passed over this jordan  and now i am become two bands   
   deliver me  i pray thee  from the hand of my brother  from the hand of esau  for i fear him  lest he will come and smite me   and  the mother with the children   
   and thou saidst  i will surely do thee good  and make thy seed as the sand of the sea  which cannot be numbered for multitude   
    and he lodged there that same night  and took of that which came to his hand a present for esau his brother   
   two hundred she goats  and twenty he goats  two hundred ewes  and twenty rams   
   thirty milch camels with their colts  forty kine  and ten bulls  twenty she asses  and ten foals   
   and he delivered  them  into the hand of his servants  every drove by themselves  and said unto his servants  pass over before me  and put a space betwixt drove and drove   
   and he commanded the foremost  saying  when esau my brother meeteth thee  and asketh thee  saying  whose  art  thou  and whither goest thou  and whose  are  these before thee   
   then thou shalt say   they be  thy servant jacob s  it  is  a present sent unto my lord esau  and  behold  also he  is  behind us   
   and so commanded he the second  and the third  and all that followed the droves  saying  on this manner shall ye speak unto esau  when ye find him   
   and say ye moreover  behold  thy servant jacob  is  behind us  for he said  i will appease him with the present that goeth before me  and afterward i will see his face  peradventure he will accept of me   
   so went the present over before him  and himself lodged that night in the company   
   and he rose up that night  and took his two wives  and his two womenservants  and his eleven sons  and passed over the ford jabbok   
   and he took them  and sent them over the brook  and sent over that he had   
    and jacob was left alone  and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day   
   and when he saw that he prevailed not against him  he touched the hollow of his thigh  and the hollow of jacob s thigh was out of joint  as he wrestled with him   
   and he said  let me go  for the day breaketh  and he said  i will not let thee go  except thou bless me   
   and he said unto him  what  is  thy name  and he said  jacob   
   and he said  thy name shall be called no more jacob  but israel  for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men  and hast prevailed   
   and jacob asked  him   and said  tell  me   i pray thee  thy name  and he said  wherefore  is  it  that  thou dost ask after my name  and he blessed him there   
   and jacob called the name of the place peniel  for i have seen god face to face  and my life is preserved   
   and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him  and he halted upon his thigh   
   therefore the children of israel eat not  of  the sinew which shrank  which  is  upon the hollow of the thigh  unto this day  because he touched the hollow of jacob s thigh in the sinew that shrank   
genesis    
   and jacob lifted up his eyes  and looked  and  behold  esau came  and with him four hundred men  and he divided the children unto leah  and unto rachel  and unto the two handmaids   
  and he put the handmaids and their children foremost  and leah and her children after  and rachel and joseph hindermost   
  and he passed over before them  and bowed himself to the ground seven times  until he came near to his brother   
  and esau ran to meet him  and embraced him  and fell on his neck  and kissed him  and they wept   
   and he lifted up his eyes  and saw the women and the children  and said  who  are  those with thee  and he said  the children which god hath graciously given thy servant   
  then the handmaidens came near  they and their children  and they bowed themselves   
  and leah also with her children came near  and bowed themselves  and after came joseph near and rachel  and they bowed themselves   
  and he said  what  meanest  thou by all this drove which i met  and he said   these are  to find grace in the sight of my lord   
  and esau said  i have enough  my brother  keep that thou hast unto thyself   
   and jacob said  nay  i pray thee  if now i have found grace in thy sight  then receive my present at my hand  for therefore i have seen thy face  as though i had seen the face of god  and thou wast pleased with me   
   take  i pray thee  my blessing that is brought to thee  because god hath dealt graciously with me  and because i have enough  and he urged him  and he took  it    
   and he said  let us take our journey  and let us go  and i will go before thee   
   and he said unto him  my lord knoweth that the children  are  tender  and the flocks and herds with young  are  with me  and if men should overdrive them one day  all the flock will die   
   let my lord  i pray thee  pass over before his servant  and i will lead on softly  according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure  until i come unto my lord unto seir   
   and esau said  let me now leave with thee  some  of the folk that  are  with me  and he said  what needeth it  let me find grace in the sight of my lord   
    so esau returned that day on his way unto seir   
   and jacob journeyed to succoth  and built him an house  and made booths for his cattle  therefore the name of the place is called succoth   
   and jacob came to shalem  a city of shechem  which  is  in the land of canaan  when he came from padanaram  and pitched his tent before the city   
   and he bought a parcel of a field  where he had spread his tent  at the hand of the children of hamor  shechem s father  for an hundred pieces of money   
   and he erected there an altar  and called it elelohe israel   
genesis    
   and dinah the daughter of leah  which she bare unto jacob  went out to see the daughters of the land   
  and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite  prince of the country  saw her  he took her  and lay with her  and defiled her   
  and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob  and he loved the damsel  and spake kindly unto the damsel   
  and shechem spake unto his father hamor  saying  get me this damsel to wife   
  and jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter  now his sons were with his cattle in the field  and jacob held his peace until they were come   
   and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him   
  and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard  it   and the men were grieved  and they were very wroth  because he had wrought folly in israel in lying with jacob s daughter  which thing ought not to be done   
  and hamor communed with them  saying  the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter  i pray you give her him to wife   
  and make ye marriages with us   and  give your daughters unto us  and take our daughters unto you   
   and ye shall dwell with us  and the land shall be before you  dwell and trade ye therein  and get you possessions therein   
   and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren  let me find grace in your eyes  and what ye shall say unto me i will give   
   ask me never so much dowry and gift  and i will give according as ye shall say unto me  but give me the damsel to wife   
   and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father deceitfully  and said  because he had defiled dinah their sister   
   and they said unto them  we cannot do this thing  to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised  for that  were  a reproach unto us   
   but in this will we consent unto you  if ye will be as we  be   that every male of you be circumcised   
   then will we give our daughters unto you  and we will take your daughters to us  and we will dwell with you  and we will become one people   
   but if ye will not hearken unto us  to be circumcised  then will we take our daughter  and we will be gone   
    and their words pleased hamor  and shechem hamor s son   
   and the young man deferred not to do the thing  because he had delight in jacob s daughter  and he  was  more honourable than all the house of his father   
   and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city  and communed with the men of their city  saying   
   these men  are  peaceable with us  therefore let them dwell in the land  and trade therein  for the land  behold   it is  large enough for them  let us take their daughters to us for wives  and let us give them our daughters   
   only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us  to be one people  if every male among us be circumcised  as they  are  circumcised   
    shall  not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs  be  ours  only let us consent unto them  and they will dwell with us   
   and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city  and every male was circumcised  all that went out of the gate of his city   
    and it came to pass on the third day  when they were sore  that two of the sons of jacob  simeon and levi  dinah s brethren  took each man his sword  and came upon the city boldly  and slew all the males   
   and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword  and took dinah out of shechem s house  and went out   
   the sons of jacob came upon the slain  and spoiled the city  because they had defiled their sister   
   they took their sheep  and their oxen  and their asses  and that which  was  in the city  and that which  was  in the field   
   and all their wealth  and all their little ones  and their wives took they captive  and spoiled even all that  was  in the house   
   and jacob said to simeon and levi  ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land  among the canaanites and the perizzites  and i  being  few in number  they shall gather themselves together against me  and slay me  and i shall be destroyed  i and my house   
   and they said  should he deal with our sister as with an harlot   
genesis    
   and god said unto jacob  arise  go up to bethel  and dwell there  and make there an altar unto god  that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of esau thy brother   
  then jacob said unto his household  and to all that  were  with him  put away the strange gods that  are  among you  and be clean  and change your garments   
  and let us arise  and go up to bethel  and i will make there an altar unto god  who answered me in the day of my distress  and was with me in the way which i went   
  and they gave unto jacob all the strange gods which  were  in their hand  and  all their  earrings which  were  in their ears  and jacob hid them under the oak which  was  by shechem   
  and they journeyed  and the terror of god was upon the cities that  were  round about them  and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob   
   so jacob came to luz  which  is  in the land of canaan  that  is   bethel  he and all the people that  were  with him   
  and he built there an altar  and called the place elbethel  because there god appeared unto him  when he fled from the face of his brother   
  but deborah rebekah s nurse died  and she was buried beneath bethel under an oak  and the name of it was called allonbachuth   
  and god appeared unto jacob again  when he came out of padanaram  and blessed him   
   and god said unto him  thy name  is  jacob  thy name shall not be called any more jacob  but israel shall be thy name  and he called his name israel   
   and god said unto him  i  am  god almighty  be fruitful and multiply  a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee  and kings shall come out of thy loins   
   and the land which i gave abraham and isaac  to thee i will give it  and to thy seed after thee will i give the land   
   and god went up from him in the place where he talked with him   
   and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him   even  a pillar of stone  and he poured a drink offering thereon  and he poured oil thereon   
   and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him  bethel   
    and they journeyed from bethel  and there was but a little way to come to ephrath  and rachel travailed  and she had hard labour   
   and it came to pass  when she was in hard labour  that the midwife said unto her  fear not  thou shalt have this son also   
   and it came to pass  as her soul was in departing   for she died  that she called his name benoni  but his father called him benjamin   
   and rachel died  and was buried in the way to ephrath  which  is  bethlehem   
   and jacob set a pillar upon her grave  that  is  the pillar of rachel s grave unto this day   
    and israel journeyed  and spread his tent beyond the tower of edar   
   and it came to pass  when israel dwelt in that land  that reuben went and lay with bilhah his father s concubine  and israel heard  it   now the sons of jacob were twelve   
   the sons of leah  reuben  jacob s firstborn  and simeon  and levi  and judah  and issachar  and zebulun   
   the sons of rachel  joseph  and benjamin   
   and the sons of bilhah  rachel s handmaid  dan  and naphtali   
   and the sons of zilpah  leah s handmaid  gad  and asher  these  are  the sons of jacob  which were born to him in padanaram   
   and jacob came unto isaac his father unto mamre  unto the city of arbah  which  is  hebron  where abraham and isaac sojourned   
   and the days of isaac were an hundred and fourscore years   
   and isaac gave up the ghost  and died  and was gathered unto his people   being  old and full of days  and his sons esau and jacob buried him   
genesis    
   now these  are  the generations of esau  who  is  edom   
  esau took his wives of the daughters of canaan  adah the daughter of elon the hittite  and aholibamah the daughter of anah the daughter of zibeon the hivite   
  and bashemath ishmael s daughter  sister of nebajoth   
  and adah bare to esau eliphaz  and bashemath bare reuel   
  and aholibamah bare jeush  and jaalam  and korah  these  are  the sons of esau  which were born unto him in the land of canaan   
  and esau took his wives  and his sons  and his daughters  and all the persons of his house  and his cattle  and all his beasts  and all his substance  which he had got in the land of canaan  and went into the country from the face of his brother jacob   
  for their riches were more than that they might dwell together  and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle   
  thus dwelt esau in mount seir  esau  is  edom

genesis    
   and jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger  in the land of canaan   
  these  are  the generations of jacob  joseph   being  seventeen years old  was feeding the flock with his brethren  and the lad  was  with the sons of bilhah  and with the sons of zilpah  his father s wives  and joseph brought unto his father their evil report   
  now israel loved joseph more than all his children  because he  was  the son of his old age  and he made him a coat of  many  colours   
  and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren  they hated him  and could not speak peaceably unto him   
   and joseph dreamed a dream  and he told  it  his brethren  and they hated him yet the more   
  and he said unto them  hear  i pray you  this dream which i have dreamed   
  for  behold  we  were  binding sheaves in the field  and  lo  my sheaf arose  and also stood upright  and  behold  your sheaves stood round about  and made obeisance to my sheaf   
  and his brethren said to him  shalt thou indeed reign over us  or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us  and they hated him yet the more for his dreams  and for his words   
  and he dreamed yet another dream  and told it his brethren  and said  behold  i have dreamed a dream more  and  behold  the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me   
   and he told  it  to his father  and to his brethren  and his father rebuked him  and said unto him  what  is  this dream that thou hast dreamed  shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth   
   and his brethren envied him  but his father observed the saying   
    and his brethren went to feed their father s flock in shechem   
   and israel said unto joseph  do not thy brethren feed  the flock  in shechem  come  and i will send thee unto them  and he said to him  here  am i    
   and he said to him  go  i pray thee  see whether it be well with thy brethren  and well with the flocks  and bring me word again  so he sent him out of the vale of hebron  and he came to shechem   
   and a certain man found him  and  behold   he was  wandering in the field  and the man asked him  saying  what seekest thou   
   and he said  i seek my brethren  tell me  i pray thee  where they feed  their flocks    
   and the man said  they are departed hence  for i heard them say  let us go to dothan  and joseph went after his brethren  and found them in dothan   
   and when they saw him afar off  even before he came near unto them  they conspired against him to slay him   
   and they said one to another  behold  this dreamer cometh   
   come now therefore  and let us slay him  and cast him into some pit  and we will say  some evil beast hath devoured him  and we shall see what will become of his dreams   
   and reuben heard  it   and he delivered him out of their hands  and said  let us not kill him   
   and reuben said unto them  shed no blood   but  cast him into this pit that  is  in the wilderness  and lay no hand upon him  that he might rid him out of their hands  to deliver him to his father again   
    and it came to pass  when joseph was come unto his brethren  that they stript joseph out of his coat   his  coat of  many  colours that  was  on him   
   and they took him  and cast him into a pit  and the pit  was  empty   there was  no water in it   
   and they sat down to eat bread  and they lifted up their eyes and looked  and  behold  a company of ishmeelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh  going to carry  it  down to egypt   
   and judah said unto his brethren  what profit  is it  if we slay our brother  and conceal his blood   
   come  and let us sell him to the ishmeelites  and let not our hand be upon him  for he  is  our brother  and  our flesh  and his brethren were content   
   then there passed by midianites merchantmen  and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit  and sold joseph to the ishmeelites for twenty  pieces  of silver  and they brought joseph into egypt   
   and reuben returned unto the pit  and  behold  joseph  was  not in the pit  and he rent his clothes   
   and he returned unto his brethren  and said  the child  is  not  and i  whither shall i go   
    and they took joseph s coat  and killed a kid of the goats  and dipped the coat in the blood   
   and they sent the coat of  many  colours  and they brought  it  to their father  and said  this have we found  know now whether it  be  thy son s coat or no   
   and he knew it  and said   it is  my son s coat  an evil beast hath devoured him  joseph is without doubt rent in pieces   
   and jacob rent his clothes  and put sackcloth upon his loins  and mourned for his son many days   
   and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him  but he refused to be comforted  and he said  for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning  thus his father wept for him   
   and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar  an officer of pharaoh s   and  captain of the guard   
genesis    
   and it came to pass at that time  that judah went down from his brethren  and turned in to a certain adullamite  whose name  was  hirah   
  and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite  whose name  was  shuah  and he took her  and went in unto her   
  and she conceived  and bare a son  and he called his name er   
  and she conceived again  and bare a son  and she called his name onan   
  and she yet again conceived  and bare a son  and called his name shelah  and he was at chezib  when she bare him   
  and judah took a wife for er his firstborn  whose name  was  tamar   
  and er  judah s firstborn  was wicked in the sight of the lord  and the lord slew him   
  and judah said unto onan  go in unto thy brother s wife  and marry her  and raise up seed to thy brother   
  and onan knew that the seed should not be his  and it came to pass  when he went in unto his brother s wife  that he spilled  it  on the ground  lest that he should give seed to his brother   
   and the thing which he did displeased the lord  wherefore he slew him also   
   then said judah to tamar his daughter in law  remain a widow at thy father s house  till shelah my son be grown  for he said  lest peradventure he die also  as his brethren  did   and tamar went and dwelt in her father s house   
    and in process of time the daughter of shuah judah s wife died  and judah was comforted  and went up unto his sheepshearers to timnath  he and his friend hirah the adullamite   
   and it was told tamar  saying  behold thy father in law goeth up to timnath to shear his sheep   
   and she put her widow s garments off from her  and covered her with a vail  and wrapped herself  and sat in an open place  which  is  by the way to timnath  for she saw that shelah was grown  and she was not given unto him to wife   
   when judah saw her  he thought her  to be  an harlot  because she had covered her face   
   and he turned unto her by the way  and said  go to  i pray thee  let me come in unto thee   for he knew not that she  was  his daughter in law   and she said  what wilt thou give me  that thou mayest come in unto me   
   and he said  i will send  thee  a kid from the flock  and she said  wilt thou give  me  a pledge  till thou send  it    
   and he said  what pledge shall i give thee  and she said  thy signet  and thy bracelets  and thy staff that  is  in thine hand  and he gave  it  her  and came in unto her  and she conceived by him   
   and she arose  and went away  and laid by her vail from her  and put on the garments of her widowhood   
   and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamite  to receive  his  pledge from the woman s hand  but he found her not   
   then he asked the men of that place  saying  where  is  the harlot  that  was  openly by the way side  and they said  there was no harlot in this  place    
   and he returned to judah  and said  i cannot find her  and also the men of the place said   that  there was no harlot in this  place    
   and judah said  let her take  it  to her  lest we be shamed  behold  i sent this kid  and thou hast not found her   
    and it came to pass about three months after  that it was told judah  saying  tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot  and also  behold  she  is  with child by whoredom  and judah said  bring her forth  and let her be burnt   
   when she  was  brought forth  she sent to her father in law  saying  by the man  whose these  are  am  i with child  and she said  discern  i pray thee  whose  are  these  the signet  and bracelets  and staff   
   and judah acknowledged  them   and said  she hath been more righteous than i  because that i gave her not to shelah my son  and he knew her again no more   
   and it came to pass in the time of her travail  that  behold  twins  were  in her womb   
   and it came to pass  when she travailed  that  the one  put out  his  hand  and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread  saying  this came out first   
   and it came to pass  as he drew back his hand  that  behold  his brother came out  and she said  how hast thou broken forth   this  breach  be  upon thee  therefore his name was called pharez   
   and afterward came out his brother  that had the scarlet thread upon his hand  and his name was called zarah   
genesis    
   and joseph was brought down to egypt  and potiphar  an officer of pharaoh  captain of the guard  an egyptian  bought him of the hands of the ishmeelites  which had brought him down thither   
  and the lord was with joseph  and he was a prosperous man  and he was in the house of his master the egyptian   
  and his master saw that the lord  was  with him  and that the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand   
  and joseph found grace in his sight  and he served him  and he made him overseer over his house  and all  that  he had he put into his hand   
  and it came to pass from the time  that  he had made him overseer in his house  and over all that he had  that the lord blessed the egyptian s house for joseph s sake  and the blessing of the lord was upon all that he had in the house  and in the field   
  and he left all that he had in joseph s hand  and he knew not ought he had  save the bread which he did eat  and joseph was  a  goodly  person   and well favoured   
   and it came to pass after these things  that his master s wife cast her eyes upon joseph  and she said  lie with me   
  but he refused  and said unto his master s wife  behold  my master wotteth not what  is  with me in the house  and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand   
   there is  none greater in this house than i  neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee  because thou  art  his wife  how then can i do this great wickedness  and sin against god   
   and it came to pass  as she spake to joseph day by day  that he hearkened not unto her  to lie by her   or  to be with her   
   and it came to pass about this time  that  joseph  went into the house to do his business  and  there was  none of the men of the house there within   
   and she caught him by his garment  saying  lie with me  and he left his garment in her hand  and fled  and got him out   
    and it came to pass  when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand  and was fled forth   
   that she called unto the men of her house  and spake unto them  saying  see  he hath brought in an hebrew unto us to mock us  he came in unto me to lie with me  and i cried with a loud voice   
   and it came to pass  when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried  that he left his garment with me  and fled  and got him out   
   and she laid up his garment by her  until his lord came home   
   and she spake unto him according to these words  saying  the hebrew servant  which thou hast brought unto us  came in unto me to mock me   
   and it came to pass  as i lifted up my voice and cried  that he left his garment with me  and fled out   
    and it came to pass  when his master heard the words of his wife  which she spake unto him  saying  after this manner did thy servant to me  that his wrath was kindled   
   and joseph s master took him  and put him into the prison  a place where the king s prisoners  were  bound  and he was there in the prison   
   but the lord was with joseph  and shewed him mercy  and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison   
   and the keeper of the prison committed to joseph s hand all the prisoners that  were  in the prison  and whatsoever they did there  he was the doer  of it    
   the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing  that was  under his hand  because the lord was with him  and  that  which he did  the lord made  it  to prosper   
genesis    
   and it came to pass after these things   that  the butler of the king of egypt and  his  baker had offended their lord the king of egypt   
  and pharaoh was wroth against two  of  his officers  against the chief of the butlers  and against the chief of the bakers   
  and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard  into the prison  the place where joseph  was  bound   
  and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them  and he served them  and they continued a season in ward   
   and they dreamed a dream both of them  each man his dream in one night  each man according to the interpretation of his dream  the butler and the baker of the king of egypt  which  were  bound in the prison   
  and joseph came in unto them in the morning  and looked upon them  and  behold  they  were  sad   
  and he asked pharaoh s officers that  were  with him in the ward of his lord s house  saying  wherefore look ye  so  sadly to day   
  and they said unto him  we have dreamed a dream  and  there is  no interpreter of it  and joseph said unto them   do  not interpretations  belong  to god  tell me  them   i pray you   
  and the chief butler told his dream to joseph  and said to him  in my dream  behold  a vine  was  before me   
   and in the vine  were  three branches  and it  was  as though it budded   and  her blossoms shot forth  and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes   
   and pharaoh s cup  was  in my hand  and i took the grapes  and pressed them into pharaoh s cup  and i gave the cup into pharaoh s hand   
   and joseph said unto him  this  is  the interpretation of it  the three branches  are  three days   
   yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thine head  and restore thee unto thy place  and thou shalt deliver pharaoh s cup into his hand  after the former manner when thou wast his butler   
   but think on me when it shall be well with thee  and shew kindness  i pray thee  unto me  and make mention of me unto pharaoh  and bring me out of this house   
   for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews  and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon   
   when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good  he said unto joseph  i also  was  in my dream  and  behold   i had  three white baskets on my head   
   and in the uppermost basket  there was  of all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh  and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head   
   and joseph answered and said  this  is  the interpretation thereof  the three baskets  are  three days   
   yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee  and shall hang thee on a tree  and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee   
    and it came to pass the third day   which was  pharaoh s birthday  that he made a feast unto all his servants  and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants   
   and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again  and he gave the cup into pharaoh s hand   
   but he hanged the chief baker  as joseph had interpreted to them   
   yet did not the chief butler remember joseph  but forgat him   
genesis    
   and it came to pass at the end of two full years  that pharaoh dreamed  and  behold  he stood by the river   
  and  behold  there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed  and they fed in a meadow   
  and  behold  seven other kine came up after them out of the river  ill favoured and leanfleshed  and stood by the  other  kine upon the brink of the river   
  and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine  so pharaoh awoke   
  and he slept and dreamed the second time  and  behold  seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk  rank and good   
  and  behold  seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them   
  and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears  and pharaoh awoke  and  behold   it was  a dream   
  and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled  and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt  and all the wise men thereof  and pharaoh told them his dream  but  there was  none that could interpret them unto pharaoh   
   then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh  saying  i do remember my faults this day   
   pharaoh was wroth with his servants  and put me in ward in the captain of the guard s house   both  me and the chief baker   
   and we dreamed a dream in one night  i and he  we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream   
   and  there was  there with us a young man  an hebrew  servant to the captain of the guard  and we told him  and he interpreted to us our dreams  to each man according to his dream he did interpret   
   and it came to pass  as he interpreted to us  so it was  me he restored unto mine office  and him he hanged   
   then pharaoh sent and called joseph  and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon  and he shaved  himself   and changed his raiment  and came in unto pharaoh   
   and pharaoh said unto joseph  i have dreamed a dream  and  there is  none that can interpret it  and i have heard say of thee   that  thou canst understand a dream to interpret it   
   and joseph answered pharaoh  saying   it is  not in me  god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace   
    and pharaoh said unto joseph  in my dream  behold  i stood upon the bank of the river   
   and  behold  there came up out of the river seven kine  fatfleshed and well favoured  and they fed in a meadow   
   and  behold  seven other kine came up after them  poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed  such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness   
   and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine   
   and when they had eaten them up  it could not be known that they had eaten them  but they  were  still ill favoured  as at the beginning  so i awoke   
   and i saw in my dream  and  behold  seven ears came up in one stalk  full and good   
   and  behold  seven ears  withered  thin   and  blasted with the east wind  sprung up after them   
   and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears  and i told  this  unto the magicians  but  there was  none that could declare  it  to me   
   and joseph said unto pharaoh  the dream of pharaoh  is  one  god hath shewed pharaoh what he  is  about to do   
   the seven good kine  are  seven years  and the seven good ears  are  seven years  the dream  is  one   
   and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them  are  seven years  and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine   
   this  is  the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh  what god  is  about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh   
   behold  there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt   
   and there shall arise after them seven years of famine  and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt  and the famine shall consume the land   
   and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following  for it  shall be  very grievous   
   and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice   it is  because the thing  is  established by god  and god will shortly bring it to pass   
    now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise  and set him over the land of egypt   
   let pharaoh do  this   and let him appoint officers over the land  and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years   
   and let them gather all the food of those good years that come  and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh  and let them keep food in the cities   
   and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine  which shall be in the land of egypt  that the land perish not through the famine   
   and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh  and in the eyes of all his servants   
   and pharaoh said unto his servants  can we find  such a one  as this  is   a man in whom the spirit of god  is    
   and pharaoh said unto joseph  forasmuch as god hath shewed thee all this   there is  none so discreet and wise as thou  art    
   thou shalt be over my house  and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled  only in the throne will i be greater than thou   
   and pharaoh said unto joseph  see  i have set thee over all the land of egypt   
   and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand  and put it upon joseph s hand  and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen  and put a gold chain about his neck   
   and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had  and they cried before him  bow the knee  and he made him  ruler  over all the land of egypt   
   and pharaoh said unto joseph  i  am  pharaoh  and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt   
   and pharaoh called joseph s name zaphnathpaaneah  and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on  and joseph went out over  all  the land of egypt   
    and joseph  was  thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt  and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh  and went throughout all the land of egypt   
   and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls   
   and he gathered up all the food of the seven years  which were in the land of egypt  and laid up the food in the cities  the food of the field  which  was  round about every city  laid he up in the same   
   and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea  very much  until he left numbering  for  it was  without number   
   and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came  which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto him   
   and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh  for god   said he   hath made me forget all my toil  and all my father s house   
   and the name of the second called he ephraim  for god hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction   
   and the seven years of plenteousness  that was in the land of egypt  were ended   
   and the seven years of dearth began to come  according as joseph had said  and the dearth was in all lands  but in all the land of egypt there was bread   
   and when all the land of egypt was famished  the people cried to pharaoh for bread  and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians  go unto joseph  what he saith to you  do   
   and the famine was over all the face of the earth  and joseph opened all the storehouses  and sold unto the egyptians  and the famine waxed sore in the land of egypt   
   and all countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy  corn   because that the famine was  so  sore in all lands   
genesis    
   now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt  jacob said unto his sons  why do ye look one upon another   
  and he said  behold  i have heard that there is corn in egypt  get you down thither  and buy for us from thence  that we may live  and not die   
  and joseph s ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt   
  but benjamin  joseph s brother  jacob sent not with his brethren  for he said  lest peradventure mischief befall him   
  and the sons of israel came to buy  corn  among those that came  for the famine was in the land of canaan   
  and joseph  was  the governor over the land   and  he  it was  that sold to all the people of the land  and joseph s brethren came  and bowed down themselves before him  with  their faces to the earth   
   and joseph saw his brethren  and he knew them  but made himself strange unto them  and spake roughly unto them  and he said unto them  whence come ye  and they said  from the land of canaan to buy food   
  and joseph knew his brethren  but they knew not him   
  and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them  and said unto them  ye  are  spies  to see the nakedness of the land ye are come   
   and they said unto him  nay  my lord  but to buy food are thy servants come   
   we  are  all one man s sons  we  are  true  men   thy servants are no spies   
   and he said unto them  nay  but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come   
   and they said  thy servants  are  twelve brethren  the sons of one man in the land of canaan  and  behold  the youngest  is  this day with our father  and one  is  not   
   and joseph said unto them  that  is it  that i spake unto you  saying  ye  are  spies   
   hereby ye shall be proved  by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence  except your youngest brother come hither   
   send one of you  and let him fetch your brother  and ye shall be kept in prison  that your words may be proved  whether  there be any  truth in you  or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye  are  spies   
   and he put them all together into ward three days   
   and joseph said unto them the third day  this do  and live   for  i fear god   
   if ye  be  true  men   let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison  go ye  carry corn for the famine of your houses   
   but bring your youngest brother unto me  so shall your words be verified  and ye shall not die  and they did so   
    and they said one to another  we  are  verily guilty concerning our brother  in that we saw the anguish of his soul  when he besought us  and we would not hear  therefore is this distress come upon us   
   and reuben answered them  saying  spake i not unto you  saying  do not sin against the child  and ye would not hear  therefore  behold  also his blood is required   
   and they knew not that joseph understood  them   for he spake unto them by an interpreter   
   and he turned himself about from them  and wept  and returned to them again  and communed with them  and took from them simeon  and bound him before their eyes   
   then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn  and to restore every man s money into his sack  and to give them provision for the way  and thus did he unto them   
   and they laded their asses with the corn  and departed thence   
   and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn  he espied his money  for  behold  it  was  in his sack s mouth   
   and he said unto his brethren  my money is restored  and  lo   it is  even in my sack  and their heart failed  them   and they were afraid  saying one to another  what  is  this  that  god hath done unto us   
    and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan  and told him all that befell unto them  saying   
   the man   who is  the lord of the land  spake roughly to us  and took us for spies of the country   
   and we said unto him  we  are  true  men   we are no spies   
   we  be  twelve brethren  sons of our father  one  is  not  and the youngest  is  this day with our father in the land of canaan   
   and the man  the lord of the country  said unto us  hereby shall i know that ye  are  true  men   leave one of your brethren  here  with me  and take  food for  the famine of your households  and be gone   
   and bring your youngest brother unto me  then shall i know that ye  are  no spies  but  that  ye  are  true  men  so  will i deliver you your brother  and ye shall traffick in the land   
   and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks  that  behold  every man s bundle of money  was  in his sack  and when  both  they and their father saw the bundles of money  they were afraid   
   and jacob their father said unto them  me have ye bereaved  of my children   joseph  is  not  and simeon  is  not  and ye will take benjamin  away   all these things are against me   
   and reuben spake unto his father  saying  slay my two sons  if i bring him not to thee  deliver him into my hand  and i will bring him to thee again   
   and he said  my son shall not go down with you  for his brother is dead  and he is left alone  if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go  then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave   
genesis    
   and the famine  was  sore in the land   
  and it came to pass  when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of egypt  their father said unto them  go again  buy us a little food   
  and judah spake unto him  saying  the man did solemnly protest unto us  saying  ye shall not see my face  except your brother  be  with you   
  if thou wilt send our brother with us  we will go down and buy thee food   
  but if thou wilt not send  him   we will not go down  for the man said unto us  ye shall not see my face  except your brother  be  with you   
  and israel said  wherefore dealt ye  so  ill with me   as  to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother   
  and they said  the man asked us straitly of our state  and of our kindred  saying   is  your father yet alive  have ye  another  brother  and we told him according to the tenor of these words  could we certainly know that he would say  bring your brother down   
  and judah said unto israel his father  send the lad with me  and we will arise and go  that we may live  and not die  both we  and thou   and  also our little ones   
  i will be surety for him  of my hand shalt thou require him  if i bring him not unto thee  and set him before thee  then let me bear the blame for ever   
   for except we had lingered  surely now we had returned this second time   
    and their father israel said unto them  if  it must be  so now  do this  take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels  and carry down the man a present  a little balm  and a little honey  spices  and myrrh  nuts  and almonds   
   and take double money in your hand  and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks  carry  it  again in your hand  peradventure it  was  an oversight   
   take also your brother  and arise  go again unto the man   
   and god almighty give you mercy before the man  that he may send away your other brother  and benjamin  if i be bereaved  of my children   i am bereaved   
    and the men took that present  and they took double money in their hand  and benjamin  and rose up  and went down to egypt  and stood before joseph   
   and when joseph saw benjamin with them  he said to the ruler of his house  bring  these  men home  and slay  and make ready  for  these  men shall dine with me at noon   
   and the man did as joseph bade  and the man brought the men into joseph s house   
   and the men were afraid  because they were brought into joseph s house  and they said  because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in  that he may seek occasion against us  and fall upon us  and take us for bondmen  and our asses   
   and they came near to the steward of joseph s house  and they communed with him at the door of the house   
   and said  o sir  we came indeed down at the first time to buy food   
   and it came to pass  when we came to the inn  that we opened our sacks  and  behold   every  man s money  was  in the mouth of his sack  our money in full weight  and we have brought it again in our hand   
   and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food  we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks   
   and he said  peace  be  to you  fear not  your god  and the god of your father  hath given you treasure in your sacks  i had your money  and he brought simeon out unto them   
   and the man brought the men into joseph s house  and gave  them  water  and they washed their feet  and he gave their asses provender   
   and they made ready the present against joseph came at noon  for they heard that they should eat bread there   
    and when joseph came home  they brought him the present which  was  in their hand into the house  and bowed themselves to him to the earth   
   and he asked them of  their  welfare  and said   is  your father well  the old man of whom ye spake   is  he yet alive   
   and they answered  thy servant our father  is  in good health  he  is  yet alive  and they bowed down their heads  and made obeisance   
   and he lifted up his eyes  and saw his brother benjamin  his mother s son  and said   is  this your younger brother  of whom ye spake unto me  and he said  god be gracious unto thee  my son   
   and joseph made haste  for his bowels did yearn upon his brother  and he sought  where  to weep  and he entered into  his  chamber  and wept there   
   and he washed his face  and went out  and refrained himself  and said  set on bread   
   and they set on for him by himself  and for them by themselves  and for the egyptians  which did eat with him  by themselves  because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews  for that  is  an abomination unto the egyptians   
   and they sat before him  the firstborn according to his birthright  and the youngest according to his youth  and the men marvelled one at another   
   and he took  and sent  messes unto them from before him  but benjamin s mess was five times so much as any of theirs  and they drank  and were merry with him   
genesis    
   and he commanded the steward of his house  saying  fill the men s sacks  with  food  as much as they can carry  and put every man s money in his sack s mouth   
  and put my cup  the silver cup  in the sack s mouth of the youngest  and his corn money  and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken   
  as soon as the morning was light  the men were sent away  they and their asses   
   and  when they were gone out of the city   and  not  yet  far off  joseph said unto his steward  up  follow after the men  and when thou dost overtake them  say unto them  wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good   
   is  not this  it  in which my lord drinketh  and whereby indeed he divineth  ye have done evil in so doing   
  and he overtook them  and he spake unto them these same words   
  and they said unto him  wherefore saith my lord these words  god forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing   
  behold  the money  which we found in our sacks  mouths  we brought again unto thee out of the land of canaan  how then should we steal out of thy lord s house silver or gold   
  with whomsoever of thy servants it be found  both let him die  and we also will be my lord s bondmen   
   and he said  now also  let  it  be  according unto your words  he with whom it is found shall be my servant  and ye shall be blameless   
   then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground  and opened every man his sack   
   and he searched   and  began at the eldest  and left at the youngest  and the cup was found in benjamin s sack   
   then they rent their clothes  and laded every man his ass  and returned to the city   
   and judah and his brethren came to joseph s house  for he  was  yet there  and they fell before him on the ground   
   and joseph said unto them  what deed  is  this that ye have done  wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine   
   and judah said  what shall we say unto my lord  what shall we speak  or how shall we clear ourselves  god hath found out the iniquity of thy servants  behold  we  are  my lord s servants  both we  and  he  also with whom the cup is found   
   and he said  god forbid that i should do so   but  the man in whose hand the cup is found  he shall be my servant  and as for you  get you up in peace unto your father   
    then judah came near unto him  and said  oh my lord  let thy servant  i pray thee  speak a word in my lord s ears  and let not thine anger burn against thy servant  for thou  art  even as pharaoh   
   my lord asked his servants  saying  have ye a father  or a brother   
   and we said unto my lord  we have a father  an old man  and a child of his old age  a little one  and his brother is dead  and he alone is left of his mother  and his father loveth him   
   and thou saidst unto thy servants  bring him down unto me  that i may set mine eyes upon him   
   and we said unto my lord  the lad cannot leave his father  for  if  he should leave his father   his father  would die   
   and thou saidst unto thy servants  except your youngest brother come down with you  ye shall see my face no more   
   and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father  we told him the words of my lord   
   and our father said  go again   and  buy us a little food   
   and we said  we cannot go down  if our youngest brother be with us  then will we go down  for we may not see the man s face  except our youngest brother  be  with us   
   and thy servant my father said unto us  ye know that my wife bare me two  sons    
   and the one went out from me  and i said  surely he is torn in pieces  and i saw him not since   
   and if ye take this also from me  and mischief befall him  ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave   
   now therefore when i come to thy servant my father  and the lad  be  not with us  seeing that his life is bound up in the lad s life   
   it shall come to pass  when he seeth that the lad  is  not  with us   that he will die  and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave   
   for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father  saying  if i bring him not unto thee  then i shall bear the blame to my father for ever   
   now therefore  i pray thee  let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord  and let the lad go up with his brethren   
   for how shall i go up to my father  and the lad  be  not with me  lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father   
genesis    
   then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him  and he cried  cause every man to go out from me  and there stood no man with him  while joseph made himself known unto his brethren   
  and he wept aloud  and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard   
  and joseph said unto his brethren  i  am  joseph  doth my father yet live  and his brethren could not answer him  for they were troubled at his presence   
  and joseph said unto his brethren  come near to me  i pray you  and they came near  and he said  i  am  joseph your brother  whom ye sold into egypt   
  now therefore be not grieved  nor angry with yourselves  that ye sold me hither  for god did send me before you to preserve life   
  for these two years  hath  the famine  been  in the land  and yet  there are  five years  in the which  there shall  neither  be  earing nor harvest   
  and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth  and to save your lives by a great deliverance   
  so now  it was  not you  that  sent me hither  but god  and he hath made me a father to pharaoh  and lord of all his house  and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt   
  haste ye  and go up to my father  and say unto him  thus saith thy son joseph  god hath made me lord of all egypt  come down unto me  tarry not   
   and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen  and thou shalt be near unto me  thou  and thy children  and thy children s children  and thy flocks  and thy herds  and all that thou hast   
   and there will i nourish thee  for yet  there are  five years of famine  lest thou  and thy household  and all that thou hast  come to poverty   
   and  behold  your eyes see  and the eyes of my brother benjamin  that  it is  my mouth that speaketh unto you   
   and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt  and of all that ye have seen  and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither   
   and he fell upon his brother benjamin s neck  and wept  and benjamin wept upon his neck   
   moreover he kissed all his brethren  and wept upon them  and after that his brethren talked with him   
    and the fame thereof was heard in pharaoh s house  saying  joseph s brethren are come  and it pleased pharaoh well  and his servants   
   and pharaoh said unto joseph  say unto thy brethren  this do ye  lade your beasts  and go  get you unto the land of canaan   
   and take your father and your households  and come unto me  and i will give you the good of the land of egypt  and ye shall eat the fat of the land   
   now thou art commanded  this do ye  take you wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones  and for your wives  and bring your father  and come   
   also regard not your stuff  for the good of all the land of egypt  is  yours   
   and the children of israel did so  and joseph gave them wagons  according to the commandment of pharaoh  and gave them provision for the way   
   to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment  but to benjamin he gave three hundred  pieces  of silver  and five changes of raiment   
   and to his father he sent after this  manner   ten asses laden with the good things of egypt  and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way   
   so he sent his brethren away  and they departed  and he said unto them  see that ye fall not out by the way   
    and they went up out of egypt  and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father   
   and told him  saying  joseph  is  yet alive  and he  is  governor over all the land of egypt  and jacob s heart fainted  for he believed them not   
   and they told him all the words of joseph  which he had said unto them  and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him  the spirit of jacob their father revived   
   and israel said   it is  enough  joseph my son  is  yet alive  i will go and see him before i die   
genesis    
   and israel took his journey with all that he had  and came to beersheba  and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac   
  and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night  and said  jacob  jacob  and he said  here  am  i   
  and he said  i  am  god  the god of thy father  fear not to go down into egypt  for i will there make of thee a great nation   
  i will go down with thee into egypt  and i will also surely bring thee up  again   and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes   
   and jacob rose up from beersheba  and the sons of israel carried jacob their father  and their little ones  and their wives  in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him   
  and they took their cattle  and their goods  which they had gotten in the land of canaan  and came into egypt  jacob  and all his seed with him   
  his sons  and his sons  sons with him  his daughters  and his sons  daughters  and all his seed brought he with him into egypt   
  and these  are  the names of the children of israel  which came into egypt  jacob and his sons  reuben  jacob s firstborn   
  and the sons of reuben  hanoch  and phallu  and hezron  and carmi   
   and the sons of simeon  jemuel  and jamin  and ohad  and jachin  and zohar  and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman   
   and the sons of levi  gershon  kohath  and merari   
   and the sons of judah  er  and onan  and shelah  and pharez  and zerah  but er and onan died in the land of canaan  and the sons of pharez were hezron and hamul   
   and the sons of issachar  tola  and phuvah  and job  and shimron   
   and the sons of zebulun  sered  and elon  and jahleel   
   these  be  the sons of leah  which she bare unto jacob in padanaram  with his daughter dinah  all the souls of his sons and his daughters  were  thirty and three   
   and the sons of gad  ziphion  and haggi  shuni  and ezbon  eri  and arodi  and areli   
   and the sons of asher  jimnah  and ishuah  and isui  and beriah  and serah their sister  and the sons of beriah  heber  and malchiel   
   these  are  the sons of zilpah  whom laban gave to leah his daughter  and these she bare unto jacob   even  sixteen souls   
   the sons of rachel jacob s wife  joseph  and benjamin   
   and unto joseph in the land of egypt were born manasseh and ephraim  which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto him   
   and the sons of benjamin  were  belah  and becher  and ashbel  gera  and naaman  ehi  and rosh  muppim  and huppim  and ard   
   these  are  the sons of rachel  which were born to jacob  all the souls  were  fourteen   
   and the sons of dan  hushim   
   and the sons of naphtali  jahzeel  and guni  and jezer  and shillem   
   these  are  the sons of bilhah  which laban gave unto rachel his daughter  and she bare these unto jacob  all the souls  were  seven   
   all the souls that came with jacob into egypt  which came out of his loins  besides jacob s sons  wives  all the souls  were  threescore and six   
   and the sons of joseph  which were born him in egypt   were  two souls  all the souls of the house of jacob  which came into egypt   were  threescore and ten   
    and he sent judah before him unto joseph  to direct his face unto goshen  and they came into the land of goshen   
   and joseph made ready his chariot  and went up to meet israel his father  to goshen  and presented himself unto him  and he fell on his neck  and wept on his neck a good while   
   and israel said unto joseph  now let me die  since i have seen thy face  because thou  art  yet alive   
   and joseph said unto his brethren  and unto his father s house  i will go up  and shew pharaoh  and say unto him  my brethren  and my father s house  which  were  in the land of canaan  are come unto me   
   and the men  are  shepherds  for their trade hath been to feed cattle  and they have brought their flocks  and their herds  and all that they have   
   and it shall come to pass  when pharaoh shall call you  and shall say  what  is  your occupation   
   that ye shall say  thy servants  trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now  both we   and  also our fathers  that ye may dwell in the land of goshen  for every shepherd  is  an abomination unto the egyptians   
genesis    
   then joseph came and told pharaoh  and said  my father and my brethren  and their flocks  and their herds  and all that they have  are come out of the land of canaan  and  behold  they  are  in the land of goshen   
  and he took some of his brethren   even  five men  and presented them unto pharaoh   
  and pharaoh said unto his brethren  what  is  your occupation  and they said unto pharaoh  thy servants  are  shepherds  both we   and  also our fathers   
  they said moreover unto pharaoh  for to sojourn in the land are we come  for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks  for the famine  is  sore in the land of canaan  now therefore  we pray thee  let thy servants dwell in the land of goshen   
  and pharaoh spake unto joseph  saying  thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee   
  the land of egypt  is  before thee  in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell  in the land of goshen let them dwell  and if thou knowest  any  men of activity among them  then make them rulers over my cattle   
  and joseph brought in jacob his father  and set him before pharaoh  and jacob blessed pharaoh   
  and pharaoh said unto jacob  how old  art  thou   
  and jacob said unto pharaoh  the days of the years of my pilgrimage  are  an hundred and thirty years  few and evil have the days of the years of my life been  and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage   
   and jacob blessed pharaoh  and went out from before pharaoh   
   and joseph placed his father and his brethren  and gave them a possession in the land of egypt  in the best of the land  in the land of rameses  as pharaoh had commanded   
   and joseph nourished his father  and his brethren  and all his father s household  with bread  according to  their  families   
    and  there was  no bread in all the land  for the famine  was  very sore  so that the land of egypt and  all  the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine   
   and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt  and in the land of canaan  for the corn which they bought  and joseph brought the money into pharaoh s house   
   and when money failed in the land of egypt  and in the land of canaan  all the egyptians came unto joseph  and said  give us bread  for why should we die in thy presence  for the money faileth   
   and joseph said  give your cattle  and i will give you for your cattle  if money fail   
   and they brought their cattle unto joseph  and joseph gave them bread  in exchange  for horses  and for the flocks  and for the cattle of the herds  and for the asses  and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year   
   when that year was ended  they came unto him the second year  and said unto him  we will not hide  it  from my lord  how that our money is spent  my lord also hath our herds of cattle  there is not ought left in the sight of my lord  but our bodies  and our lands   
   wherefore shall we die before thine eyes  both we and our land  buy us and our land for bread  and we and our land will be servants unto pharaoh  and give  us  seed  that we may live  and not die  that the land be not desolate   
   and joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh  for the egyptians sold every man his field  because the famine prevailed over them  so the land became pharaoh s   
   and as for the people  he removed them to cities from  one  end of the borders of egypt even to the  other  end thereof   
   only the land of the priests bought he not  for the priests had a portion  assigned them  of pharaoh  and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them  wherefore they sold not their lands   
   then joseph said unto the people  behold  i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh  lo   here is  seed for you  and ye shall sow the land   
   and it shall come to pass in the increase  that ye shall give the fifth  part  unto pharaoh  and four parts shall be your own  for seed of the field  and for your food  and for them of your households  and for food for your little ones   
   and they said  thou hast saved our lives  let us find grace in the sight of my lord  and we will be pharaoh s servants   
   and joseph made it a law over the land of egypt unto this day   that  pharaoh should have the fifth  part   except the land of the priests only   which  became not pharaoh s   
    and israel dwelt in the land of egypt  in the country of goshen  and they had possessions therein  and grew  and multiplied exceedingly   
   and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years  so the whole age of jacob was an hundred forty and seven years   
   and the time drew nigh that israel must die  and he called his son joseph  and said unto him  if now i have found grace in thy sight  put  i pray thee  thy hand under my thigh  and deal kindly and truly with me  bury me not  i pray thee  in egypt   
   but i will lie with my fathers  and thou shalt carry me out of egypt  and bury me in their buryingplace  and he said  i will do as thou hast said   
   and he said  swear unto me  and he sware unto him  and israel bowed himself upon the bed s head   
genesis    
   and it came to pass after these things  that  one  told joseph  behold  thy father  is  sick  and he took with him his two sons  manasseh and ephraim   
  and  one  told jacob  and said  behold  thy son joseph cometh unto thee  and israel strengthened himself  and sat upon the bed   
  and jacob said unto joseph  god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan  and blessed me   
  and said unto me  behold  i will make thee fruitful  and multiply thee  and i will make of thee a multitude of people  and will give this land to thy seed after thee  for  an everlasting possession   
  and now thy two sons  ephraim and manasseh  which were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt   are  mine  as reuben and simeon  they shall be mine   
  and thy issue  which thou begettest after them  shall be thine   and  shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance   
  and as for me  when i came from padan  rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way  when yet  there was  but a little way to come unto ephrath  and i buried her there in the way of ephrath  the same  is  bethlehem   
   and israel beheld joseph s sons  and said  who  are  these   
  and joseph said unto his father  they  are  my sons  whom god hath given me in this  place   and he said  bring them  i pray thee  unto me  and i will bless them   
   now the eyes of israel were dim for age   so that  he could not see  and he brought them near unto him  and he kissed them  and embraced them   
   and israel said unto joseph  i had not thought to see thy face  and  lo  god hath shewed me also thy seed   
   and joseph brought them out from between his knees  and he bowed himself with his face to the earth   
   and joseph took them both  ephraim in his right hand toward israel s left hand  and manasseh in his left hand toward israel s right hand  and brought  them  near unto him   
   and israel stretched out his right hand  and laid  it  upon ephraim s head  who  was  the younger  and his left hand upon manasseh s head  guiding his hands wittingly  for manasseh  was  the firstborn   
   and he blessed joseph  and said  god  before whom my fathers abraham and isaac did walk  the god which fed me all my life long unto this day   
   the angel which redeemed me from all evil  bless the lads  and let my name be named on them  and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac  and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth   
   and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim  it displeased him  and he held up his father s hand  to remove it from ephraim s head unto manasseh s head   
   and joseph said unto his father  not so  my father  for this  is  the firstborn  put thy right hand upon his head   
   and his father refused  and said  i know  it   my son  i know  it   he also shall become a people  and he also shall be great  but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he  and his seed shall become a multitude of nations   
   and he blessed them that day  saying  in thee shall israel bless  saying  god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh  and he set ephraim before manasseh   
   and israel said unto joseph  behold  i die  but god shall be with you  and bring you again unto the land of your fathers   
   moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren  which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow   
genesis    
   and jacob called unto his sons  and said  gather yourselves together  that i may tell you  that  which shall befall you in the last days   
  gather yourselves together  and hear  ye sons of jacob  and hearken unto israel your father   
  reuben  thou  art  my firstborn  my might  and the beginning of my strength  the excellency of dignity  and the excellency of power   
  unstable as water  thou shalt not excel  because thou wentest up to thy father s bed  then defiledst thou  it   he went up to my couch   
   simeon and levi  are  brethren  instruments of cruelty  are in  their habitations   
  o my soul  come not thou into their secret  unto their assembly  mine honour  be not thou united  for in their anger they slew a man  and in their selfwill they digged down a wall   
  cursed  be  their anger  for  it was  fierce  and their wrath  for it was cruel  i will divide them in jacob  and scatter them in israel   
   judah  thou  art he  whom thy brethren shall praise  thy hand  shall be  in the neck of thine enemies  thy father s children shall bow down before thee   
  judah  is  a lion s whelp  from the prey  my son  thou art gone up  he stooped down  he couched as a lion  and as an old lion  who shall rouse him up   
   the sceptre shall not depart from judah  nor a lawgiver from between his feet  until shiloh come  and unto him  shall  the gathering of the people  be    
   binding his foal unto the vine  and his ass s colt unto the choice vine  he washed his garments in wine  and his clothes in the blood of grapes   
   his eyes  shall be  red with wine  and his teeth white with milk   
    zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea  and he  shall be  for an haven of ships  and his border  shall be  unto zidon   
   issachar  is  a strong ass couching down between two burdens   
   and he saw that rest  was  good  and the land that  it was  pleasant  and bowed his shoulder to bear  and became a servant unto tribute   
   dan shall judge his people  as one of the tribes of israel   
   dan shall be a serpent by the way  an adder in the path  that biteth the horse heels  so that his rider shall fall backward   
   i have waited for thy salvation  o lord   
   gad  a troop shall overcome him  but he shall overcome at the last   
   out of asher his bread  shall be  fat  and he shall yield royal dainties   
   naphtali  is  a hind let loose  he giveth goodly words   
    joseph  is  a fruitful bough   even  a fruitful bough by a well   whose  branches run over the wall   
   the archers have sorely grieved him  and shot  at him   and hated him   
   but his bow abode in strength  and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty  god  of jacob   from thence  is  the shepherd  the stone of israel    
    even  by the god of thy father  who shall help thee  and by the almighty  who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above  blessings of the deep that lieth under  blessings of the breasts  and of the womb   
   the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills  they shall be on the head of joseph  and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren   
   benjamin shall ravin  as  a wolf  in the morning he shall devour the prey  and at night he shall divide the spoil   
    all these  are  the twelve tribes of israel  and this  is it  that their father spake unto them  and blessed them  every one according to his blessing he blessed them   
   and he charged them  and said unto them  i am to be gathered unto my people  bury me with my fathers in the cave that  is  in the field of ephron the hittite   
   in the cave that  is  in the field of machpelah  which  is  before mamre  in the land of canaan  which abraham bought with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace   
   there they buried abraham and sarah his wife  there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife  and there i buried leah   
   the purchase of the field and of the cave that  is  therein  was  from the children of heth   
   and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons  he gathered up his feet into the bed  and yielded up the ghost  and was gathered unto his people   
genesis    
   and joseph fell upon his father s face  and wept upon him  and kissed him   
  and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father  and the physicians embalmed israel   
  and forty days were fulfilled for him  for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed  and the egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days   
  and when the days of his mourning were past  joseph spake unto the house of pharaoh  saying  if now i have found grace in your eyes  speak  i pray you  in the ears of pharaoh  saying   
  my father made me swear  saying  lo  i die  in my grave which i have digged for me in the land of canaan  there shalt thou bury me  now therefore let me go up  i pray thee  and bury my father  and i will come again   
  and pharaoh said  go up  and bury thy father  according as he made thee swear   
   and joseph went up to bury his father  and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh  the elders of his house  and all the elders of the land of egypt   
  and all the house of joseph  and his brethren  and his father s house  only their little ones  and their flocks  and their herds  they left in the land of goshen   
  and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen  and it was a very great company   
   and they came to the threshingfloor of atad  which  is  beyond jordan  and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation  and he made a mourning for his father seven days   
   and when the inhabitants of the land  the canaanites  saw the mourning in the floor of atad  they said  this  is  a grievous mourning to the egyptians  wherefore the name of it was called abelmizraim  which  is  beyond jordan   
   and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them   
   for his sons carried him into the land of canaan  and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah  which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite  before mamre   
   and joseph returned into egypt  he  and his brethren  and all that went up with him to bury his father  after he had buried his father   
    and when joseph s brethren saw that their father was dead  they said  joseph will peradventure hate us  and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him   
   and they sent a messenger unto joseph  saying  thy father did command before he died  saying   
   so shall ye say unto joseph  forgive  i pray thee now  the trespass of thy brethren  and their sin  for they did unto thee evil  and now  we pray thee  forgive the trespass of the servants of the god of thy father  and joseph wept when they spake unto him   
   and his brethren also went and fell down before his face  and they said  behold  we  be  thy servants   
   and joseph said unto them  fear not  for  am  i in the place of god   
   but as for you  ye thought evil against me   but  god meant it unto good  to bring to pass  as  it is  this day  to save much people alive   
   now therefore fear ye not  i will nourish you  and your little ones  and he comforted them  and spake kindly unto them   
    and joseph dwelt in egypt  he  and his father s house  and joseph lived an hundred and ten years   
   and joseph saw ephraim s children of the third  generation   the children also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up upon joseph s knees   
   and joseph said unto his brethren  i die  and god will surely visit you  and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham  to isaac  and to jacob   
   and joseph took an oath of the children of israel  saying  god will surely visit you  and ye shall carry up my bones from hence   
   so joseph died   being  an hundred and ten years old  and they embalmed him  and he was put in a coffin in egypt   
 
exodus 
exodus   
   now these  are  the names of the children of israel  which came into egypt  every man and his household came with jacob   
  reuben  simeon  levi  and judah   
  issachar  zebulun  and benjamin   
  dan  and naphtali  gad  and asher   
  and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy souls  for joseph was in egypt  already    
  and joseph died  and all his brethren  and all that generation   
  and the children of israel were fruitful  and increased abundantly  and multiplied  and waxed exceeding mighty  and the land was filled with them   
   now there arose up a new king over egypt  which knew not joseph   
  and he said unto his people  behold  the people of the children of israel  are  more and mightier than we   
   come on  let us deal wisely with them  lest they multiply  and it come to pass  that  when there falleth out any war  they join also unto our enemies  and fight against us  and  so  get them up out of the land   
   therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens  and they built for pharaoh treasure cities  pithom and raamses   
   but the more they afflicted them  the more they multiplied and grew  and they were grieved because of the children of israel   
   and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigour   
   and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage  in morter  and in brick  and in all manner of service in the field  all their service  wherein they made them serve   was  with rigour   
    and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives  of which the name of the one  was  shiphrah  and the name of the other puah   
   and he said  when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women  and see  them  upon the stools  if it  be  a son  then ye shall kill him  but if it  be  a daughter  then she shall live   
   but the midwives feared god  and did not as the king of egypt commanded them  but saved the men children alive   
   and the king of egypt called for the midwives  and said unto them  why have ye done this thing  and have saved the men children alive   
   and the midwives said unto pharaoh  because the hebrew women  are  not as the egyptian women  for they  are  lively  and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them   
   therefore god dealt well with the midwives  and the people multiplied  and waxed very mighty   
   and it came to pass  because the midwives feared god  that he made them houses   
   and pharaoh charged all his people  saying  every son that is born ye shall cast into the river  and every daughter ye shall save alive   
exodus   
   and there went a man of the house of levi  and took  to wife  a daughter of levi   
  and the woman conceived  and bare a son  and when she saw him that he  was a  goodly  child   she hid him three months   
  and when she could not longer hide him  she took for him an ark of bulrushes  and daubed it with slime and with pitch  and put the child therein  and she laid  it  in the flags by the river s brink   
  and his sister stood afar off  to wit what would be done to him   
   and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash  herself  at the river  and her maidens walked along by the river s side  and when she saw the ark among the flags  she sent her maid to fetch it   
  and when she had opened  it   she saw the child  and  behold  the babe wept  and she had compassion on him  and said  this  is one  of the hebrews  children   
  then said his sister to pharaoh s daughter  shall i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew women  that she may nurse the child for thee   
  and pharaoh s daughter said to her  go  and the maid went and called the child s mother   
  and pharaoh s daughter said unto her  take this child away  and nurse it for me  and i will give  thee  thy wages  and the woman took the child  and nursed it   
   and the child grew  and she brought him unto pharaoh s daughter  and he became her son  and she called his name moses  and she said  because i drew him out of the water   
    and it came to pass in those days  when moses was grown  that he went out unto his brethren  and looked on their burdens  and he spied an egyptian smiting an hebrew  one of his brethren   
   and he looked this way and that way  and when he saw that  there was  no man  he slew the egyptian  and hid him in the sand   
   and when he went out the second day  behold  two men of the hebrews strove together  and he said to him that did the wrong  wherefore smitest thou thy fellow   
   and he said  who made thee a prince and a judge over us  intendest thou to kill me  as thou killedst the egyptian  and moses feared  and said  surely this thing is known   
   now when pharaoh heard this thing  he sought to slay moses  but moses fled from the face of pharaoh  and dwelt in the land of midian  and he sat down by a well   
    now the priest of midian had seven daughters  and they came and drew  water   and filled the troughs to water their father s flock   
   and the shepherds came and drove them away  but moses stood up and helped them  and watered their flock   
   and when they came to reuel their father  he said  how  is it that  ye are come so soon to day   
   and they said  an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds  and also drew  water  enough for us  and watered the flock   
   and he said unto his daughters  and where  is  he  why  is  it  that  ye have left the man  call him  that he may eat bread   
   and moses was content to dwell with the man  and he gave moses zipporah his daughter   
   and she bare  him  a son  and he called his name gershom  for he said  i have been a stranger in a strange land   
    and it came to pass in process of time  that the king of egypt died  and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage  and they cried  and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage   
   and god heard their groaning  and god remembered his covenant with abraham  with isaac  and with jacob   
   and god looked upon the children of israel  and god had respect unto  them    
exodus   
   now moses kept the flock of jethro his father in law  the priest of midian  and he led the flock to the backside of the desert  and came to the mountain of god   even  to horeb   
  and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush  and he looked  and  behold  the bush burned with fire  and the bush  was  not consumed   
  and moses said  i will now turn aside  and see this great sight  why the bush is not burnt   
  and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see  god called unto him out of the midst of the bush  and said  moses  moses  and he said  here  am  i   
  and he said  draw not nigh hither  put off thy shoes from off thy feet  for the place whereon thou standest  is  holy ground   
  moreover he said  i  am  the god of thy father  the god of abraham  the god of isaac  and the god of jacob  and moses hid his face  for he was afraid to look upon god   
   and the lord said  i have surely seen the affliction of my people which  are  in egypt  and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters  for i know their sorrows   
  and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians  and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large  unto a land flowing with milk and honey  unto the place of the canaanites  and the hittites  and the amorites  and the perizzites  and the hivites  and the jebusites   
  now therefore  behold  the cry of the children of israel is come unto me  and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them   
   come now therefore  and i will send thee unto pharaoh  that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt   
    and moses said unto god  who  am  i  that i should go unto pharaoh  and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt   
   and he said  certainly i will be with thee  and this  shall be  a token unto thee  that i have sent thee  when thou hast brought forth the people out of egypt  ye shall serve god upon this mountain   
   and moses said unto god  behold   when  i come unto the children of israel  and shall say unto them  the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you  and they shall say to me  what  is  his name  what shall i say unto them   
   and god said unto moses  i am that i am  and he said  thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel  i am hath sent me unto you   
   and god said moreover unto moses  thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel  the lord god of your fathers  the god of abraham  the god of isaac  and the god of jacob  hath sent me unto you  this  is  my name for ever  and this  is  my memorial unto all generations   
    go  and gather the elders of israel together  and say unto them  the lord god of your fathers  the god of abraham  of isaac  and of jacob  appeared unto me  saying  i have surely visited you  and  seen  that which is done to you in egypt   
   and i have said  i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites  and the hittites  and the amorites  and the perizzites  and the hivites  and the jebusites  unto a land flowing with milk and honey   
   and they shall hearken to thy voice  and thou shalt come  thou and the elders of israel  unto the king of egypt  and ye shall say unto him  the lord god of the hebrews hath met with us  and now let us go  we beseech thee  three days  journey into the wilderness  that we may sacrifice to the lord our god   
   and i am sure that the king of egypt will not let you go  no  not by a mighty hand   
   and i will stretch out my hand  and smite egypt with all my wonders which i will do in the midst thereof  and after that he will let you go   
   and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians  and it shall come to pass  that  when ye go  ye shall not go empty   
   but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour  and of her that sojourneth in her house  jewels of silver  and jewels of gold  and raiment  and ye shall put  them  upon your sons  and upon your daughters  and ye shall spoil the egyptians   
exodus   
   and moses answered and said  but  behold  they will not believe me  nor hearken unto my voice  for they will say  the lord hath not appeared unto thee   
  and the lord said unto him  what  is  that in thine hand  and he said  a rod   
  and he said  cast it on the ground  and he cast it on the ground  and it became a serpent  and moses fled from before it   
  and the lord said unto moses  put forth thine hand  and take it by the tail  and he put forth his hand  and caught it  and it became a rod in his hand   
  that they may believe that the lord god of their fathers  the god of abraham  the god of isaac  and the god of jacob  hath appeared unto thee   
  and the lord said furthermore unto him  put now thine hand into thy bosom  and he put his hand into his bosom  and when he took it out  behold  his hand  was  leprous as snow   
  and he said  put thine hand into thy bosom again  and he put his hand into his bosom again  and plucked it out of his bosom  and  behold  it was turned again as his  other  flesh   
  and it shall come to pass  if they will not believe thee  neither hearken to the voice of the first sign  that they will believe the voice of the latter sign   
  and it shall come to pass  if they will not believe also these two signs  neither hearken unto thy voice  that thou shalt take of the water of the river  and pour  it  upon the dry  land   and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry  land    
    and moses said unto the lord  o my lord  i  am  not eloquent  neither heretofore  nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant  but i  am  slow of speech  and of a slow tongue   
   and the lord said unto him  who hath made man s mouth  or who maketh the dumb  or deaf  or the seeing  or the blind  have not i the lord   
   now therefore go  and i will be with thy mouth  and teach thee what thou shalt say   
   and he said  o my lord  send  i pray thee  by the hand  of him whom  thou wilt send   
   and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses  and he said   is  not aaron the levite thy brother  i know that he can speak well  and also  behold  he cometh forth to meet thee  and when he seeth thee  he will be glad in his heart   
   and thou shalt speak unto him  and put words in his mouth  and i will be with thy mouth  and with his mouth  and will teach you what ye shall do   
   and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people  and he shall be   even  he shall be to thee instead of a mouth  and thou shalt be to him instead of god   
   and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand  wherewith thou shalt do signs   
    and moses went and returned to jethro his father in law  and said unto him  let me go  i pray thee  and return unto my brethren which  are  in egypt  and see whether they be yet alive  and jethro said to moses  go in peace   
   and the lord said unto moses in midian  go  return into egypt  for all the men are dead which sought thy life   
   and moses took his wife and his sons  and set them upon an ass  and he returned to the land of egypt  and moses took the rod of god in his hand   
   and the lord said unto moses  when thou goest to return into egypt  see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh  which i have put in thine hand  but i will harden his heart  that he shall not let the people go   
   and thou shalt say unto pharaoh  thus saith the lord  israel  is  my son   even  my firstborn   
   and i say unto thee  let my son go  that he may serve me  and if thou refuse to let him go  behold  i will slay thy son   even  thy firstborn   
    and it came to pass by the way in the inn  that the lord met him  and sought to kill him   
   then zipporah took a sharp stone  and cut off the foreskin of her son  and cast  it  at his feet  and said  surely a bloody husband  art  thou to me   
   so he let him go  then she said  a bloody husband  thou art   because of the circumcision   
   and the lord said to aaron  go into the wilderness to meet moses  and he went  and met him in the mount of god  and kissed him   
   and moses told aaron all the words of the lord who had sent him  and all the signs which he had commanded him   
   and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel   
   and aaron spake all the words which the lord had spoken unto moses  and did the signs in the sight of the people   
   and the people believed  and when they heard that the lord had visited the children of israel  and that he had looked upon their affliction  then they bowed their heads and worshipped   
exodus   
   and afterward moses and aaron went in  and told pharaoh  thus saith the lord god of israel  let my people go  that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness   
  and pharaoh said  who  is  the lord  that i should obey his voice to let israel go  i know not the lord  neither will i let israel go   
   and they said  the god of the hebrews hath met with us  let us go  we pray thee  three days  journey into the desert  and sacrifice unto the lord our god  lest he fall upon us with pestilence  or with the sword   
  and the king of egypt said unto them  wherefore do ye  moses and aaron  let the people from their works  get you unto your burdens   
  and pharaoh said  behold  the people of the land now  are  many  and ye make them rest from their burdens   
  and pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people  and their officers  saying   
  ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick  as heretofore  let them go and gather straw for themselves   
  and the tale of the bricks  which they did make heretofore  ye shall lay upon them  ye shall not diminish  ought  thereof  for they  be  idle  therefore they cry  saying  let us go  and  sacrifice to our god   
  let there more work be laid upon the men  that they may labour therein  and let them not regard vain words   
    and the taskmasters of the people went out  and their officers  and they spake to the people  saying  thus saith pharaoh  i will not give you straw   
   go ye  get you straw where ye can find it  yet not ought of your work shall be diminished   
   so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble instead of straw   
   and the taskmasters hasted  them   saying  fulfil your works   your  daily tasks  as when there was straw   
   and the officers of the children of israel  which pharaoh s taskmasters had set over them  were beaten   and  demanded  wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day  as heretofore   
    then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh  saying  wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants   
   there is no straw given unto thy servants  and they say to us  make brick  and  behold  thy servants  are  beaten  but the fault  is  in thine own people   
   but he said  ye  are  idle   ye are  idle  therefore ye say  let us go  and  do sacrifice to the lord   
   go therefore now   and  work  for there shall no straw be given you  yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks   
   and the officers of the children of israel did see  that  they  were  in evil  case   after it was said  ye shall not minish  ought  from your bricks of your daily task   
   and they met moses and aaron  who stood in the way  as they came forth from pharaoh   
   and they said unto them  the lord look upon you  and judge  because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh  and in the eyes of his servants  to put a sword in their hand to slay us   
   and moses returned unto the lord  and said  lord  wherefore hast thou  so  evil entreated this people  why  is  it  that  thou hast sent me   
   for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name  he hath done evil to this people  neither hast thou delivered thy people at all   
exodus   
   then the lord said unto moses  now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh  for with a strong hand shall he let them go  and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land   
  and god spake unto moses  and said unto him  i  am  the lord   
  and i appeared unto abraham  unto isaac  and unto jacob  by  the name of  god almighty  but by my name jehovah was i not known to them   
  and i have also established my covenant with them  to give them the land of canaan  the land of their pilgrimage  wherein they were strangers   
  and i have also heard the groaning of the children of israel  whom the egyptians keep in bondage  and i have remembered my covenant   
  wherefore say unto the children of israel  i  am  the lord  and i will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians  and i will rid you out of their bondage  and i will redeem you with a stretched out arm  and with great judgments   
  and i will take you to me for a people  and i will be to you a god  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord your god  which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the egyptians   
  and i will bring you in unto the land  concerning the which i did swear to give it to abraham  to isaac  and to jacob  and i will give it you for an heritage  i  am  the lord   
  and moses spake so unto the children of israel  but they hearkened not unto moses for anguish of spirit  and for cruel bondage   
    and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   go in  speak unto pharaoh king of egypt  that he let the children of israel go out of his land   
   and moses spake before the lord  saying  behold  the children of israel have not hearkened unto me  how then shall pharaoh hear me  who  am  of uncircumcised lips   
   and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron  and gave them a charge unto the children of israel  and unto pharaoh king of egypt  to bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt   
    these  be  the heads of their fathers  houses  the sons of reuben the firstborn of israel  hanoch  and pallu  hezron  and carmi  these  be  the families of reuben   
   and the sons of simeon  jemuel  and jamin  and ohad  and jachin  and zohar  and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman  these  are  the families of simeon   
   and these  are  the names of the sons of levi according to their generations  gershon  and kohath  and merari  and the years of the life of levi  were  an hundred thirty and seven years   
   the sons of gershon  libni  and shimi  according to their families   
   and the sons of kohath  amram  and izhar  and hebron  and uzziel  and the years of the life of kohath  were  an hundred thirty and three years   
   and the sons of merari  mahali and mushi  these  are  the families of levi according to their generations   
   and amram took him jochebed his father s sister to wife  and she bare him aaron and moses  and the years of the life of amram  were  an hundred and thirty and seven years   
   and the sons of izhar  korah  and nepheg  and zichri   
   and the sons of uzziel  mishael  and elzaphan  and zithri   
   and aaron took him elisheba  daughter of amminadab  sister of naashon  to wife  and she bare him nadab  and abihu  eleazar  and ithamar   
   and the sons of korah  assir  and elkanah  and abiasaph  these  are  the families of the korhites   
   and eleazar aaron s son took him  one  of the daughters of putiel to wife  and she bare him phinehas  these  are  the heads of the fathers of the levites according to their families   
   these  are  that aaron and moses  to whom the lord said  bring out the children of israel from the land of egypt according to their armies   
   these  are  they which spake to pharaoh king of egypt  to bring out the children of israel from egypt  these  are  that moses and aaron   
   and it came to pass on the day  when  the lord spake unto moses in the land of egypt   
   that the lord spake unto moses  saying  i  am  the lord  speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say unto thee   
   and moses said before the lord  behold  i  am  of uncircumcised lips  and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me   
exodus   
   and the lord said unto moses  see  i have made thee a god to pharaoh  and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet   
  thou shalt speak all that i command thee  and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh  that he send the children of israel out of his land   
  and i will harden pharaoh s heart  and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of egypt   
  but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you  that i may lay my hand upon egypt  and bring forth mine armies   and  my people the children of israel  out of the land of egypt by great judgments   
  and the egyptians shall know that i  am  the lord  when i stretch forth mine hand upon egypt  and bring out the children of israel from among them   
  and moses and aaron did as the lord commanded them  so did they   
  and moses  was  fourscore years old  and aaron fourscore and three years old  when they spake unto pharaoh   
   and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron  saying   
  when pharaoh shall speak unto you  saying  shew a miracle for you  then thou shalt say unto aaron  take thy rod  and cast  it  before pharaoh   and  it shall become a serpent   
   and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh  and they did so as the lord had commanded  and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh  and before his servants  and it became a serpent   
   then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers  now the magicians of egypt  they also did in like manner with their enchantments   
   for they cast down every man his rod  and they became serpents  but aaron s rod swallowed up their rods   
   and he hardened pharaoh s heart  that he hearkened not unto them  as the lord had said   
    and the lord said unto moses  pharaoh s heart  is  hardened  he refuseth to let the people go   
   get thee unto pharaoh in the morning  lo  he goeth out unto the water  and thou shalt stand by the river s brink against he come  and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand   
   and thou shalt say unto him  the lord god of the hebrews hath sent me unto thee  saying  let my people go  that they may serve me in the wilderness  and  behold  hitherto thou wouldest not hear   
   thus saith the lord  in this thou shalt know that i  am  the lord  behold  i will smite with the rod that  is  in mine hand upon the waters which  are  in the river  and they shall be turned to blood   
   and the fish that  is  in the river shall die  and the river shall stink  and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river   
   and the lord spake unto moses  say unto aaron  take thy rod  and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of egypt  upon their streams  upon their rivers  and upon their ponds  and upon all their pools of water  that they may become blood  and  that  there may be blood throughout all the land of egypt  both in  vessels of  wood  and in  vessels of  stone   
   and moses and aaron did so  as the lord commanded  and he lifted up the rod  and smote the waters that  were  in the river  in the sight of pharaoh  and in the sight of his servants  and all the waters that  were  in the river were turned to blood   
   and the fish that  was  in the river died  and the river stank  and the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river  and there was blood throughout all the land of egypt   
   and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments  and pharaoh s heart was hardened  neither did he hearken unto them  as the lord had said   
   and pharaoh turned and went into his house  neither did he set his heart to this also   
   and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink  for they could not drink of the water of the river   
   and seven days were fulfilled  after that the lord had smitten the river   
exodus   
   and the lord spake unto moses  go unto pharaoh  and say unto him  thus saith the lord  let my people go  that they may serve me   
  and if thou refuse to let  them  go  behold  i will smite all thy borders with frogs   
  and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly  which shall go up and come into thine house  and into thy bedchamber  and upon thy bed  and into the house of thy servants  and upon thy people  and into thine ovens  and into thy kneadingtroughs   
  and the frogs shall come up both on thee  and upon thy people  and upon all thy servants   
  and the lord spake unto moses  say unto aaron  stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams  over the rivers  and over the ponds  and cause frogs to come up upon the land of egypt   
  and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt  and the frogs came up  and covered the land of egypt   
  and the magicians did so with their enchantments  and brought up frogs upon the land of egypt   
  then pharaoh called for moses and aaron  and said  intreat the lord  that he may take away the frogs from me  and from my people  and i will let the people go  that they may do sacrifice unto the lord   
  and moses said unto pharaoh  glory over me  when shall i intreat for thee  and for thy servants  and for thy people  to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses   that  they may remain in the river only   
   and he said  to morrow  and he said   be it  according to thy word  that thou mayest know that  there is  none like unto the lord our god   
   and the frogs shall depart from thee  and from thy houses  and from thy servants  and from thy people  they shall remain in the river only   
   and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh  and moses cried unto the lord because of the frogs which he had brought against pharaoh   
   and the lord did according to the word of moses  and the frogs died out of the houses  out of the villages  and out of the fields   
   and they gathered them together upon heaps  and the land stank   
   but when pharaoh saw that there was respite  he hardened his heart  and hearkened not unto them  as the lord had said   
    and the lord said unto moses  say unto aaron  stretch out thy rod  and smite the dust of the land  that it may become lice throughout all the land of egypt   
   and they did so  for aaron stretched out his hand with his rod  and smote the dust of the earth  and it became lice in man  and in beast  all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of egypt   
   and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice  but they could not  so there were lice upon man  and upon beast   
   then the magicians said unto pharaoh  this  is  the finger of god  and pharaoh s heart was hardened  and he hearkened not unto them  as the lord had said   
    and the lord said unto moses  rise up early in the morning  and stand before pharaoh  lo  he cometh forth to the water  and say unto him  thus saith the lord  let my people go  that they may serve me   
   else  if thou wilt not let my people go  behold  i will send swarms  of flies  upon thee  and upon thy servants  and upon thy people  and into thy houses  and the houses of the egyptians shall be full of swarms  of flies   and also the ground whereon they  are    
   and i will sever in that day the land of goshen  in which my people dwell  that no swarms  of flies  shall be there  to the end thou mayest know that i  am  the lord in the midst of the earth   
   and i will put a division between my people and thy people  to morrow shall this sign be   
   and the lord did so  and there came a grievous swarm  of flies  into the house of pharaoh  and  into  his servants  houses  and into all the land of egypt  the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm  of flies    
   and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron  and said  go ye  sacrifice to your god in the land   
   and moses said  it is not meet so to do  for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to the lord our god  lo  shall we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before their eyes  and will they not stone us   
   we will go three days  journey into the wilderness  and sacrifice to the lord our god  as he shall command us   
   and pharaoh said  i will let you go  that ye may sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness  only ye shall not go very far away  intreat for me   
   and moses said  behold  i go out from thee  and i will intreat the lord that the swarms  of flies  may depart from pharaoh  from his servants  and from his people  to morrow  but let not pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the lord   
   and moses went out from pharaoh  and intreated the lord   
   and the lord did according to the word of moses  and he removed the swarms  of flies  from pharaoh  from his servants  and from his people  there remained not one   
   and pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also  neither would he let the people go   
exodus   
   then the lord said unto moses  go in unto pharaoh  and tell him  thus saith the lord god of the hebrews  let my people go  that they may serve me   
  for if thou refuse to let  them  go  and wilt hold them still   
  behold  the hand of the lord is upon thy cattle which  is  in the field  upon the horses  upon the asses  upon the camels  upon the oxen  and upon the sheep   there shall be  a very grievous murrain   
  and the lord shall sever between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt  and there shall nothing die of all  that is  the children s of israel   
  and the lord appointed a set time  saying  to morrow the lord shall do this thing in the land   
  and the lord did that thing on the morrow  and all the cattle of egypt died  but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one   
  and pharaoh sent  and  behold  there was not one of the cattle of the israelites dead  and the heart of pharaoh was hardened  and he did not let the people go   
   and the lord said unto moses and unto aaron  take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace  and let moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of pharaoh   
  and it shall become small dust in all the land of egypt  and shall be a boil breaking forth  with  blains upon man  and upon beast  throughout all the land of egypt   
   and they took ashes of the furnace  and stood before pharaoh  and moses sprinkled it up toward heaven  and it became a boil breaking forth  with  blains upon man  and upon beast   
   and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils  for the boil was upon the magicians  and upon all the egyptians   
   and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh  and he hearkened not unto them  as the lord had spoken unto moses   
    and the lord said unto moses  rise up early in the morning  and stand before pharaoh  and say unto him  thus saith the lord god of the hebrews  let my people go  that they may serve me   
   for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart  and upon thy servants  and upon thy people  that thou mayest know that  there is  none like me in all the earth   
   for now i will stretch out my hand  that i may smite thee and thy people with pestilence  and thou shalt be cut off from the earth   
   and in very deed for this  cause  have i raised thee up  for to shew  in  thee my power  and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth   
   as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people  that thou wilt not let them go   
   behold  to morrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail  such as hath not been in egypt since the foundation thereof even until now   
   send therefore now   and  gather thy cattle  and all that thou hast in the field   for upon  every man and beast which shall be found in the field  and shall not be brought home  the hail shall come down upon them  and they shall die   
   he that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses   
   and he that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and his cattle in the field   
    and the lord said unto moses  stretch forth thine hand toward heaven  that there may be hail in all the land of egypt  upon man  and upon beast  and upon every herb of the field  throughout the land of egypt   
   and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven  and the lord sent thunder and hail  and the fire ran along upon the ground  and the lord rained hail upon the land of egypt   
   so there was hail  and fire mingled with the hail  very grievous  such as there was none like it in all the land of egypt since it became a nation   
   and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that  was  in the field  both man and beast  and the hail smote every herb of the field  and brake every tree of the field   
   only in the land of goshen  where the children of israel  were   was there no hail   
   and pharaoh sent  and called for moses and aaron  and said unto them  i have sinned this time  the lord  is  righteous  and i and my people  are  wicked   
   intreat the lord  for  it is  enough  that there be no  more  mighty thunderings and hail  and i will let you go  and ye shall stay no longer   
   and moses said unto him  as soon as i am gone out of the city  i will spread abroad my hands unto the lord   and  the thunder shall cease  neither shall there be any more hail  that thou mayest know how that the earth  is  the lord s   
   but as for thee and thy servants  i know that ye will not yet fear the lord god   
   and the flax and the barley was smitten  for the barley  was  in the ear  and the flax  was  bolled   
   but the wheat and the rie were not smitten  for they  were  not grown up   
   and moses went out of the city from pharaoh  and spread abroad his hands unto the lord  and the thunders and hail ceased  and the rain was not poured upon the earth   
   and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased  he sinned yet more  and hardened his heart  he and his servants   
   and the heart of pharaoh was hardened  neither would he let the children of israel go  as the lord had spoken by moses   
exodus    
   and the lord said unto moses  go in unto pharaoh  for i have hardened his heart  and the heart of his servants  that i might shew these my signs before him   
  and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son  and of thy son s son  what things i have wrought in egypt  and my signs which i have done among them  that ye may know how that i  am  the lord   
  and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh  and said unto him  thus saith the lord god of the hebrews  how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me  let my people go  that they may serve me   
  else  if thou refuse to let my people go  behold  to morrow will i bring the locusts into thy coast   
  and they shall cover the face of the earth  that one cannot be able to see the earth  and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped  which remaineth unto you from the hail  and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field   
  and they shall fill thy houses  and the houses of all thy servants  and the houses of all the egyptians  which neither thy fathers  nor thy fathers  fathers have seen  since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day  and he turned himself  and went out from pharaoh   
  and pharaoh s servants said unto him  how long shall this man be a snare unto us  let the men go  that they may serve the lord their god  knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed   
  and moses and aaron were brought again unto pharaoh  and he said unto them  go  serve the lord your god   but  who  are  they that shall go   
  and moses said  we will go with our young and with our old  with our sons and with our daughters  with our flocks and with our herds will we go  for we  must hold  a feast unto the lord   
   and he said unto them  let the lord be so with you  as i will let you go  and your little ones  look  to it   for evil  is  before you   
   not so  go now ye  that are  men  and serve the lord  for that ye did desire  and they were driven out from pharaoh s presence   
    and the lord said unto moses  stretch out thine hand over the land of egypt for the locusts  that they may come up upon the land of egypt  and eat every herb of the land   even  all that the hail hath left   
   and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt  and the lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day  and all  that  night   and  when it was morning  the east wind brought the locusts   
   and the locusts went up over all the land of egypt  and rested in all the coasts of egypt  very grievous  were they   before them there were no such locusts as they  neither after them shall be such   
   for they covered the face of the whole earth  so that the land was darkened  and they did eat every herb of the land  and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left  and there remained not any green thing in the trees  or in the herbs of the field  through all the land of egypt   
   then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste  and he said  i have sinned against the lord your god  and against you   
   now therefore forgive  i pray thee  my sin only this once  and intreat the lord your god  that he may take away from me this death only   
   and he went out from pharaoh  and intreated the lord   
   and the lord turned a mighty strong west wind  which took away the locusts  and cast them into the red sea  there remained not one locust in all the coasts of egypt   
   but the lord hardened pharaoh s heart  so that he would not let the children of israel go   
    and the lord said unto moses  stretch out thine hand toward heaven  that there may be darkness over the land of egypt  even darkness  which  may be felt   
   and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven  and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days   
   they saw not one another  neither rose any from his place for three days  but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings   
   and pharaoh called unto moses  and said  go ye  serve the lord  only let your flocks and your herds be stayed  let your little ones also go with you   
   and moses said  thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings  that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god   
   our cattle also shall go with us  there shall not an hoof be left behind  for thereof must we take to serve the lord our god  and we know not with what we must serve the lord  until we come thither   
   but the lord hardened pharaoh s heart  and he would not let them go   
   and pharaoh said unto him  get thee from me  take heed to thyself  see my face no more  for in  that  day thou seest my face thou shalt die   
   and moses said  thou hast spoken well  i will see thy face again no more   
exodus    
   and the lord said unto moses  yet will i bring one plague  more  upon pharaoh  and upon egypt  afterwards he will let you go hence  when he shall let  you  go  he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether   
  speak now in the ears of the people  and let every man borrow of his neighbour  and every woman of her neighbour  jewels of silver  and jewels of gold   
  and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians  moreover the man moses  was  very great in the land of egypt  in the sight of pharaoh s servants  and in the sight of the people   
   and moses said  thus saith the lord  about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt   
  and all the firstborn in the land of egypt shall die  from the firstborn of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne  even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that  is  behind the mill  and all the firstborn of beasts   
  and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt  such as there was none like it  nor shall be like it any more   
  but against any of the children of israel shall not a dog move his tongue  against man or beast  that ye may know how that the lord doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel   
  and all these thy servants shall come down unto me  and bow down themselves unto me  saying  get thee out  and all the people that follow thee  and after that i will go out  and he went out from pharaoh in a great anger   
  and the lord said unto moses  pharaoh shall not hearken unto you  that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt   
   and moses and aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh  and the lord hardened pharaoh s heart  so that he would not let the children of israel go out of his land   
exodus    
   and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt  saying   
  this month  shall be  unto you the beginning of months  it  shall be  the first month of the year to you   
  speak ye unto all the congregation of israel  saying  in the tenth  day  of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb  according to the house of  their  fathers  a lamb for an house   
  and if the household be too little for the lamb  let him and his neighbour next unto his house take  it  according to the number of the souls  every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb   
  your lamb shall be without blemish  a male of the first year  ye shall take  it  out from the sheep  or from the goats   
  and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month  and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening   
  and they shall take of the blood  and strike  it  on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses  wherein they shall eat it   
  and they shall eat the flesh in that night  roast with fire  and unleavened bread   and  with bitter  herbs  they shall eat it   
  eat not of it raw  nor sodden at all with water  but roast  with  fire  his head with his legs  and with the purtenance thereof   
   and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning  and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire   
   and thus shall ye eat it   with  your loins girded  your shoes on your feet  and your staff in your hand  and ye shall eat it in haste  it  is  the lord s passover   
   for i will pass through the land of egypt this night  and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt  both man and beast  and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment  i  am  the lord   
   and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye  are   and when i see the blood  i will pass over you  and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy  you   when i smite the land of egypt   
   and this day shall be unto you for a memorial  and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations  ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever   
   seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread  even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses  for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day  that soul shall be cut off from israel   
   and in the first day  there shall be  an holy convocation  and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you  no manner of work shall be done in them  save  that  which every man must eat  that only may be done of you   
   and ye shall observe  the feast of  unleavened bread  for in this selfsame day have i brought your armies out of the land of egypt  therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever   
   in the first  month   on the fourteenth day of the month at even  ye shall eat unleavened bread  until the one and twentieth day of the month at even   
   seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses  for whosoever eateth that which is leavened  even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel  whether he be a stranger  or born in the land   
   ye shall eat nothing leavened  in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread   
    then moses called for all the elders of israel  and said unto them  draw out and take you a lamb according to your families  and kill the passover   
   and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop  and dip  it  in the blood that  is  in the bason  and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that  is  in the bason  and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning   
   for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians  and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel  and on the two side posts  the lord will pass over the door  and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite  you    
   and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever   
   and it shall come to pass  when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you  according as he hath promised  that ye shall keep this service   
   and it shall come to pass  when your children shall say unto you  what mean ye by this service   
   that ye shall say  it  is  the sacrifice of the lord s passover  who passed over the houses of the children of israel in egypt  when he smote the egyptians  and delivered our houses  and the people bowed the head and worshipped   
   and the children of israel went away  and did as the lord had commanded moses and aaron  so did they   
    and it came to pass  that at midnight the lord smote all the firstborn in the land of egypt  from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that  was  in the dungeon  and all the firstborn of cattle   
   and pharaoh rose up in the night  he  and all his servants  and all the egyptians  and there was a great cry in egypt  for  there was  not a house where  there was  not one dead   
   and he called for moses and aaron by night  and said  rise up   and  get you forth from among my people  both ye and the children of israel  and go  serve the lord  as ye have said   
   also take your flocks and your herds  as ye have said  and be gone  and bless me also   
   and the egyptians were urgent upon the people  that they might send them out of the land in haste  for they said  we  be  all dead  men    
   and the people took their dough before it was leavened  their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders   
   and the children of israel did according to the word of moses  and they borrowed of the egyptians jewels of silver  and jewels of gold  and raiment   
   and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians  so that they lent unto them  such things as they required   and they spoiled the egyptians   
    and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth  about six hundred thousand on foot  that were  men  beside children   
   and a mixed multitude went up also with them  and flocks  and herds   even  very much cattle   
   and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of egypt  for it was not leavened  because they were thrust out of egypt  and could not tarry  neither had they prepared for themselves any victual   
   now the sojourning of the children of israel  who dwelt in egypt   was  four hundred and thirty years   
   and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years  even the selfsame day it came to pass  that all the hosts of the lord went out from the land of egypt   
   it  is  a night to be much observed unto the lord for bringing them out from the land of egypt  this  is  that night of the lord to be observed of all the children of israel in their generations   
    and the lord said unto moses and aaron  this  is  the ordinance of the passover  there shall no stranger eat thereof   
   but every man s servant that is bought for money  when thou hast circumcised him  then shall he eat thereof   
   a foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof   
   in one house shall it be eaten  thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house  neither shall ye break a bone thereof   
   all the congregation of israel shall keep it   
   and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee  and will keep the passover to the lord  let all his males be circumcised  and then let him come near and keep it  and he shall be as one that is born in the land  for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof   
   one law shall be to him that is homeborn  and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you   
   thus did all the children of israel  as the lord commanded moses and aaron  so did they   
   and it came to pass the selfsame day   that  the lord did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armies   
exodus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  sanctify unto me all the firstborn  whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel   both  of man and of beast  it  is  mine   
  and moses said unto the people  remember this day  in which ye came out from egypt  out of the house of bondage  for by strength of hand the lord brought you out from this  place   there shall no leavened bread be eaten   
  this day came ye out in the month abib   
  and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites  and the hittites  and the amorites  and the hivites  and the jebusites  which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee  a land flowing with milk and honey  that thou shalt keep this service in this month   
  seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread  and in the seventh day  shall be  a feast to the lord   
  unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days  and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee  neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters   
  and thou shalt shew thy son in that day  saying   this is done  because of that  which  the lord did unto me when i came forth out of egypt   
  and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand  and for a memorial between thine eyes  that the lord s law may be in thy mouth  for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt   
   thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year   
    and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites  as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers  and shall give it thee   
   that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the matrix  and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast  the males  shall be  the lord s   
   and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb  and if thou wilt not redeem it  then thou shalt break his neck  and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem   
   and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come  saying  what  is  this  that thou shalt say unto him  by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt  from the house of bondage   
   and it came to pass  when pharaoh would hardly let us go  that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt  both the firstborn of man  and the firstborn of beast  therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the matrix  being males  but all the firstborn of my children i redeem   
   and it shall be for a token upon thine hand  and for frontlets between thine eyes  for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth out of egypt   
    and it came to pass  when pharaoh had let the people go  that god led them not  through  the way of the land of the philistines  although that  was  near  for god said  lest peradventure the people repent when they see war  and they return to egypt   
   but god led the people about   through  the way of the wilderness of the red sea  and the children of israel went up harnessed out of the land of egypt   
   and moses took the bones of joseph with him  for he had straitly sworn the children of israel  saying  god will surely visit you  and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you   
   and they took their journey from succoth  and encamped in etham  in the edge of the wilderness   
   and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud  to lead them the way  and by night in a pillar of fire  to give them light  to go by day and night   
   he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day  nor the pillar of fire by night   from  before the people   
exodus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  speak unto the children of israel  that they turn and encamp before pihahiroth  between migdol and the sea  over against baalzephon  before it shall ye encamp by the sea   
  for pharaoh will say of the children of israel  they  are  entangled in the land  the wilderness hath shut them in   
  and i will harden pharaoh s heart  that he shall follow after them  and i will be honoured upon pharaoh  and upon all his host  that the egyptians may know that i  am  the lord  and they did so   
  and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled  and the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people  and they said  why have we done this  that we have let israel go from serving us   
  and he made ready his chariot  and took his people with him   
  and he took six hundred chosen chariots  and all the chariots of egypt  and captains over every one of them   
  and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt  and he pursued after the children of israel  and the children of israel went out with an high hand   
  but the egyptians pursued after them  all the horses  and  chariots of pharaoh  and his horsemen  and his army  and overtook them encamping by the sea  beside pihahiroth  before baalzephon   
    and when pharaoh drew nigh  the children of israel lifted up their eyes  and  behold  the egyptians marched after them  and they were sore afraid  and the children of israel cried out unto the lord   
   and they said unto moses  because  there were  no graves in egypt  hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness  wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us  to carry us forth out of egypt   
    is  not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt  saying  let us alone  that we may serve the egyptians  for  it had been  better for us to serve the egyptians  than that we should die in the wilderness   
   and moses said unto the people  fear ye not  stand still  and see the salvation of the lord  which he will shew to you to day  for the egyptians whom ye have seen to day  ye shall see them again no more for ever   
   the lord shall fight for you  and ye shall hold your peace   
    and the lord said unto moses  wherefore criest thou unto me  speak unto the children of israel  that they go forward   
   but lift thou up thy rod  and stretch out thine hand over the sea  and divide it  and the children of israel shall go on dry  ground  through the midst of the sea   
   and i  behold  i will harden the hearts of the egyptians  and they shall follow them  and i will get me honour upon pharaoh  and upon all his host  upon his chariots  and upon his horsemen   
   and the egyptians shall know that i  am  the lord  when i have gotten me honour upon pharaoh  upon his chariots  and upon his horsemen   
   and the angel of god  which went before the camp of israel  removed and went behind them  and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face  and stood behind them   
   and it came between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel  and it was a cloud and darkness  to them   but it gave light by night  to these   so that the one came not near the other all the night   
    and moses stretched out his hand over the sea  and the lord caused the sea to go  back  by a strong east wind all that night  and made the sea dry  land   and the waters were divided   
   and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry  ground   and the waters  were  a wall unto them on their right hand  and on their left   
   and the egyptians pursued  and went in after them to the midst of the sea   even  all pharaoh s horses  his chariots  and his horsemen   
   and it came to pass  that in the morning watch the lord looked unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud  and troubled the host of the egyptians   
   and took off their chariot wheels  that they drave them heavily  so that the egyptians said  let us flee from the face of israel  for the lord fighteth for them against the egyptians   
   and the lord said unto moses  stretch out thine hand over the sea  that the waters may come again upon the egyptians  upon their chariots  and upon their horsemen   
   and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea  and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared  and the egyptians fled against it  and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea   
   and the waters returned  and covered the chariots  and the horsemen   and  all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after them  there remained not so much as one of them   
   but the children of israel walked upon dry  land  in the midst of the sea  and the waters  were  a wall unto them on their right hand  and on their left   
   thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians  and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore   
   and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon the egyptians  and the people feared the lord  and believed the lord  and his servant moses   
exodus    
   then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord  and spake  saying  i will sing unto the lord  for he hath triumphed gloriously  the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea   
  the lord  is  my strength and song  and he is become my salvation  he  is  my god  and i will prepare him an habitation  my father s god  and i will exalt him   
  the lord  is  a man of war  the lord  is  his name   
  pharaoh s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea  his chosen captains also are drowned in the red sea   
  the depths have covered them  they sank into the bottom as a stone   
  thy right hand  o lord  is become glorious in power  thy right hand  o lord  hath dashed in pieces the enemy   
  and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee  thou sentest forth thy wrath   which  consumed them as stubble   
  and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together  the floods stood upright as an heap   and  the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea   
  the enemy said  i will pursue  i will overtake  i will divide the spoil  my lust shall be satisfied upon them  i will draw my sword  my hand shall destroy them   
   thou didst blow with thy wind  the sea covered them  they sank as lead in the mighty waters   
   who  is  like unto thee  o lord  among the gods  who  is  like thee  glorious in holiness  fearful  in  praises  doing wonders   
   thou stretchedst out thy right hand  the earth swallowed them   
   thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people  which  thou hast redeemed  thou hast guided  them  in thy strength unto thy holy habitation   
   the people shall hear   and  be afraid  sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of palestina   
   then the dukes of edom shall be amazed  the mighty men of moab  trembling shall take hold upon them  all the inhabitants of canaan shall melt away   
   fear and dread shall fall upon them  by the greatness of thine arm they shall be  as  still as a stone  till thy people pass over  o lord  till the people pass over   which  thou hast purchased   
   thou shalt bring them in  and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance   in  the place  o lord   which  thou hast made for thee to dwell in   in  the sanctuary  o lord   which  thy hands have established   
   the lord shall reign for ever and ever   
   for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea  and the lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them  but the children of israel went on dry  land  in the midst of the sea   
   and miriam the prophetess  the sister of aaron  took a timbrel in her hand  and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances   
   and miriam answered them  sing ye to the lord  for he hath triumphed gloriously  the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea   
    so moses brought israel from the red sea  and they went out into the wilderness of shur  and they went three days in the wilderness  and found no water   
   and when they came to marah  they could not drink of the waters of marah  for they  were  bitter  therefore the name of it was called marah   
   and the people murmured against moses  saying  what shall we drink   
   and he cried unto the lord  and the lord shewed him a tree   which  when he had cast into the waters  the waters were made sweet  there he made for them a statute and an ordinance  and there he proved them   
   and said  if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god  and wilt do that which is right in his sight  and wilt give ear to his commandments  and keep all his statutes  i will put none of these diseases upon thee  which i have brought upon the egyptians  for i  am  the lord that healeth thee   
   and they came to elim  where  were  twelve wells of water  and threescore and ten palm trees  and they encamped there by the waters   
exodus    
   and they took their journey from elim  and all the congregation of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin  which  is  between elim and sinai  on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of egypt   
  and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and aaron in the wilderness   
  and the children of israel said unto them  would to god we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt  when we sat by the flesh pots   and  when we did eat bread to the full  for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness  to kill this whole assembly with hunger   
  then said the lord unto moses  behold  i will rain bread from heaven for you  and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day  that i may prove them  whether they will walk in my law  or no   
  and it shall come to pass  that on the sixth day they shall prepare  that  which they bring in  and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily   
  and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel  at even  then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from the land of egypt   
  and in the morning  then ye shall see the glory of the lord  for that he heareth your murmurings against the lord  and what  are  we  that ye murmur against us   
  and moses said   this shall be   when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat  and in the morning bread to the full  for that the lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him  and what  are  we  your murmurings  are  not against us  but against the lord   
  and moses spake unto aaron  say unto all the congregation of the children of israel  come near before the lord  for he hath heard your murmurings   
   and it came to pass  as aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of israel  that they looked toward the wilderness  and  behold  the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel  speak unto them  saying  at even ye shall eat flesh  and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord your god   
    and it came to pass  that at even the quails came up  and covered the camp  and in the morning the dew lay round about the host   
   and when the dew that lay was gone up  behold  upon the face of the wilderness  there lay  a small round thing   as  small as the hoar frost on the ground   
   and when the children of israel saw  it   they said one to another  it  is  manna  for they wist not what it  was   and moses said unto them  this  is  the bread which the lord hath given you to eat   
   this  is  the thing which the lord hath commanded  gather of it every man according to his eating  an omer for every man   according to  the number of your persons  take ye every man for  them  which  are  in his tents   
   and the children of israel did so  and gathered  some more  some less   
   and when they did mete  it  with an omer  he that gathered much had nothing over  and he that gathered little had no lack  they gathered every man according to his eating   
   and moses said  let no man leave of it till the morning   
   notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses  but some of them left of it until the morning  and it bred worms  and stank  and moses was wroth with them   
   and they gathered it every morning  every man according to his eating  and when the sun waxed hot  it melted   
    and it came to pass   that  on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread  two omers for one  man   and all the rulers of the congregation came and told moses   
   and he said unto them  this  is that  which the lord hath said  to morrow  is  the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord  bake  that  which ye will bake  to day   and seethe that ye will seethe  and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning   
   and they laid it up till the morning  as moses bade  and it did not stink  neither was there any worm therein   
   and moses said  eat that to day  for to day  is  a sabbath unto the lord  to day ye shall not find it in the field   
   six days ye shall gather it  but on the seventh day   which is  the sabbath  in it there shall be none   
   and it came to pass   that  there went out  some  of the people on the seventh day for to gather  and they found none   
   and the lord said unto moses  how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws   
   see  for that the lord hath given you the sabbath  therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days  abide ye every man in his place  let no man go out of his place on the seventh day   
   so the people rested on the seventh day   
   and the house of israel called the name thereof manna  and it  was  like coriander seed  white  and the taste of it  was  like wafers  made  with honey   
    and moses said  this  is  the thing which the lord commandeth  fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations  that they may see the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness  when i brought you forth from the land of egypt   
   and moses said unto aaron  take a pot  and put an omer full of manna therein  and lay it up before the lord  to be kept for your generations   
   as the lord commanded moses  so aaron laid it up before the testimony  to be kept   
   and the children of israel did eat manna forty years  until they came to a land inhabited  they did eat manna  until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan   
   now an omer  is  the tenth  part  of an ephah   
exodus    
   and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin  after their journeys  according to the commandment of the lord  and pitched in rephidim  and  there was  no water for the people to drink   
  wherefore the people did chide with moses  and said  give us water that we may drink  and moses said unto them  why chide ye with me  wherefore do ye tempt the lord   
  and the people thirsted there for water  and the people murmured against moses  and said  wherefore  is  this  that  thou hast brought us up out of egypt  to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst   
  and moses cried unto the lord  saying  what shall i do unto this people  they be almost ready to stone me   
  and the lord said unto moses  go on before the people  and take with thee of the elders of israel  and thy rod  wherewith thou smotest the river  take in thine hand  and go   
  behold  i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb  and thou shalt smite the rock  and there shall come water out of it  that the people may drink  and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel   
  and he called the name of the place massah  and meribah  because of the chiding of the children of israel  and because they tempted the lord  saying  is the lord among us  or not   
   then came amalek  and fought with israel in rephidim   
  and moses said unto joshua  choose us out men  and go out  fight with amalek  to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in mine hand   
   so joshua did as moses had said to him  and fought with amalek  and moses  aaron  and hur went up to the top of the hill   
   and it came to pass  when moses held up his hand  that israel prevailed  and when he let down his hand  amalek prevailed   
   but moses  hands  were  heavy  and they took a stone  and put  it  under him  and he sat thereon  and aaron and hur stayed up his hands  the one on the one side  and the other on the other side  and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun   
   and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword   
   and the lord said unto moses  write this  for  a memorial in a book  and rehearse  it  in the ears of joshua  for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven   
   and moses built an altar  and called the name of it jehovahnissi   
   for he said  because the lord hath sworn  that  the lord  will have  war with amalek from generation to generation   
exodus    
   when jethro  the priest of midian  moses  father in law  heard of all that god had done for moses  and for israel his people   and  that the lord had brought israel out of egypt   
  then jethro  moses  father in law  took zipporah  moses  wife  after he had sent her back   
  and her two sons  of which the name of the one  was  gershom  for he said  i have been an alien in a strange land   
  and the name of the other  was  eliezer  for the god of my father   said he  was  mine help  and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh   
  and jethro  moses  father in law  came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness  where he encamped at the mount of god   
  and he said unto moses  i thy father in law jethro am come unto thee  and thy wife  and her two sons with her   
   and moses went out to meet his father in law  and did obeisance  and kissed him  and they asked each other of  their  welfare  and they came into the tent   
  and moses told his father in law all that the lord had done unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israel s sake   and  all the travail that had come upon them by the way  and  how  the lord delivered them   
  and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the lord had done to israel  whom he had delivered out of the hand of the egyptians   
   and jethro said  blessed  be  the lord  who hath delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians  and out of the hand of pharaoh  who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians   
   now i know that the lord  is  greater than all gods  for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly  he was  above them   
   and jethro  moses  father in law  took a burnt offering and sacrifices for god  and aaron came  and all the elders of israel  to eat bread with moses  father in law before god   
    and it came to pass on the morrow  that moses sat to judge the people  and the people stood by moses from the morning unto the evening   
   and when moses  father in law saw all that he did to the people  he said  what  is  this thing that thou doest to the people  why sittest thou thyself alone  and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even   
   and moses said unto his father in law  because the people come unto me to enquire of god   
   when they have a matter  they come unto me  and i judge between one and another  and i do make  them  know the statutes of god  and his laws   
   and moses  father in law said unto him  the thing that thou doest  is  not good   
   thou wilt surely wear away  both thou  and this people that  is  with thee  for this thing  is  too heavy for thee  thou art not able to perform it thyself alone   
   hearken now unto my voice  i will give thee counsel  and god shall be with thee  be thou for the people to god ward  that thou mayest bring the causes unto god   
   and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws  and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk  and the work that they must do   
   moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men  such as fear god  men of truth  hating covetousness  and place  such  over them   to be  rulers of thousands   and  rulers of hundreds  rulers of fifties  and rulers of tens   
   and let them judge the people at all seasons  and it shall be   that  every great matter they shall bring unto thee  but every small matter they shall judge  so shall it be easier for thyself  and they shall bear  the burden  with thee   
   if thou shalt do this thing  and god command thee  so   then thou shalt be able to endure  and all this people shall also go to their place in peace   
   so moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law  and did all that he had said   
   and moses chose able men out of all israel  and made them heads over the people  rulers of thousands  rulers of hundreds  rulers of fifties  and rulers of tens   
   and they judged the people at all seasons  the hard causes they brought unto moses  but every small matter they judged themselves   
   and moses let his father in law depart  and he went his way into his own land   
exodus    
   in the third month  when the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt  the same day came they  into  the wilderness of sinai   
  for they were departed from rephidim  and were come  to  the desert of sinai  and had pitched in the wilderness  and there israel camped before the mount   
  and moses went up unto god  and the lord called unto him out of the mountain  saying  thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob  and tell the children of israel   
  ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians  and  how  i bare you on eagles  wings  and brought you unto myself   
  now therefore  if ye will obey my voice indeed  and keep my covenant  then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people  for all the earth  is  mine   
  and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests  and an holy nation  these  are  the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel   
  and moses came and called for the elders of the people  and laid before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him   
  and all the people answered together  and said  all that the lord hath spoken we will do  and moses returned the words of the people unto the lord   
   and the lord said unto moses  lo  i come unto thee in a thick cloud  that the people may hear when i speak with thee  and believe thee for ever  and moses told the words of the people unto the lord   
   and the lord said unto moses  go unto the people  and sanctify them to day and to morrow  and let them wash their clothes   
   and be ready against the third day  for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai   
   and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about  saying  take heed to yourselves   that ye  go  not  up into the mount  or touch the border of it  whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death   
   there shall not an hand touch it  but he shall surely be stoned  or shot through  whether  it be  beast or man  it shall not live  when the trumpet soundeth long  they shall come up to the mount   
   and moses went down from the mount unto the people  and sanctified the people  and they washed their clothes   
   and he said unto the people  be ready against the third day  come not at  your  wives   
    and it came to pass on the third day in the morning  that there were thunders and lightnings  and a thick cloud upon the mount  and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud  so that all the people that  was  in the camp trembled   
   and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with god  and they stood at the nether part of the mount   
   and mount sinai was altogether on a smoke  because the lord descended upon it in fire  and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace  and the whole mount quaked greatly   
   and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long  and waxed louder and louder  moses spake  and god answered him by a voice   
   and the lord came down upon mount sinai  on the top of the mount  and the lord called moses  up  to the top of the mount  and moses went up   
   and the lord said unto moses  go down  charge the people  lest they break through unto the lord to gaze  and many of them perish   
   and let the priests also  which come near to the lord  sanctify themselves  lest the lord break forth upon them   
   and moses said unto the lord  the people cannot come up to mount sinai  for thou chargedst us  saying  set bounds about the mount  and sanctify it   
   and the lord said unto him  away  get thee down  and thou shalt come up  thou  and aaron with thee  but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the lord  lest he break forth upon them   
   so moses went down unto the people  and spake unto them   
exodus    
   and god spake all these words  saying   
  i  am  the lord thy god  which have brought thee out of the land of egypt  out of the house of bondage   
  thou shalt have no other gods before me   
  thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image  or any likeness  of any thing  that  is  in heaven above  or that  is  in the earth beneath  or that  is  in the water under the earth   
  thou shalt not bow down thyself to them  nor serve them  for i the lord thy god  am  a jealous god  visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth  generation  of them that hate me   
  and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me  and keep my commandments   
  thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain  for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain   
  remember the sabbath day  to keep it holy   
  six days shalt thou labour  and do all thy work   
   but the seventh day  is  the sabbath of the lord thy god   in it  thou shalt not do any work  thou  nor thy son  nor thy daughter  thy manservant  nor thy maidservant  nor thy cattle  nor thy stranger that  is  within thy gates   
   for  in  six days the lord made heaven and earth  the sea  and all that in them  is   and rested the seventh day  wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day  and hallowed it   
    honour thy father and thy mother  that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee   
   thou shalt not kill   
   thou shalt not commit adultery   
   thou shalt not steal   
   thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour   
   thou shalt not covet thy neighbour s house  thou shalt not covet thy neighbour s wife  nor his manservant  nor his maidservant  nor his ox  nor his ass  nor any thing that  is  thy neighbour s   
    and all the people saw the thunderings  and the lightnings  and the noise of the trumpet  and the mountain smoking  and when the people saw  it   they removed  and stood afar off   
   and they said unto moses  speak thou with us  and we will hear  but let not god speak with us  lest we die   
   and moses said unto the people  fear not  for god is come to prove you  and that his fear may be before your faces  that ye sin not   
   and the people stood afar off  and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god  was    
    and the lord said unto moses  thus thou shalt say unto the children of israel  ye have seen that i have talked with you from heaven   
   ye shall not make with me gods of silver  neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold   
   an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me  and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings  and thy peace offerings  thy sheep  and thine oxen  in all places where i record my name i will come unto thee  and i will bless thee   
   and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone  thou shalt not build it of hewn stone  for if thou lift up thy tool upon it  thou hast polluted it   
   neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar  that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon   
exodus    
   now these  are  the judgments which thou shalt set before them   
  if thou buy an hebrew servant  six years he shall serve  and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing

  and if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant  she shall not go out as the menservants do

  and if he have betrothed her unto his son  he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters   
   if he take him another  wife   her food  her raiment  and her duty of marriage  shall he not diminish

    he that smiteth a man  so that he die  shall be surely put to death   
   and if a man lie not in wait  but god deliver  him  into his hand  then i will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee

   and if men strive together  and one smite another with a stone  or with  his  fist  and he die not  but keepeth  his  bed

   and if  any  mischief follow  then thou shalt give life for life   
   eye for eye  tooth for tooth  hand for hand  foot for foot   
   burning for burning  wound for wound  stripe for stripe   
   and if a man smite the eye of his servant  or the eye of his maid  that it perish  he shall let him go free for his eye s sake   
   and if he smite out his manservant s tooth  or his maidservant s tooth  he shall let him go free for his tooth s sake   
   if an ox gore a man or a woman  that they die  then the ox shall be surely stoned  and his flesh shall not be eaten  but the owner of the ox  shall be  quit   
   but if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past  and it hath been testified to his owner  and he hath not kept him in  but that he hath killed a man or a woman  the ox shall be stoned  and his owner also shall be put to death   
   if there be laid on him a sum of money  then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him   
   whether he have gored a son  or have gored a daughter  according to this judgment shall it be done unto him   
   if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant  he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver  and the ox shall be stoned   
   and if a man shall open a pit  or if a man shall dig a pit  and not cover it  and an ox or an ass fall therein   
   the owner of the pit shall make  it  good   and  give money unto the owner of them  and the dead  beast  shall be his   
   and if one man s ox hurt another s  that he die  then they shall sell the live ox  and divide the money of it  and the dead  ox  also they shall divide

exodus    
   if a man shall steal an ox  or a sheep  and kill it  or sell it  he shall restore five oxen for an ox  and four sheep for a sheep

  for all manner of trespass   whether it be  for ox  for ass  for sheep  for raiment   or  for any manner of lost thing  which  another  challengeth to be his  the cause of both parties shall come before the judges   and  whom the judges shall condemn  he shall pay double unto his neighbour   
   if a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass  or an ox  or a sheep  or any beast  to keep  and it die  or be hurt  or driven away  no man seeing  it    
    then  shall an oath of the lord be between them both  that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour s goods  and the owner of it shall accept  thereof   and he shall not make  it  good

   ye shall not afflict any widow  or fatherless child   
   if thou afflict them in any wise  and they cry at all unto me  i will surely hear their cry   
   and my wrath shall wax hot  and i will kill you with the sword  and your wives shall be widows  and your children fatherless   
    if thou lend money to  any of  my people  that is  poor by thee  thou shalt not be to him as an usurer  neither shalt thou lay upon him usury   
   if thou at all take thy neighbour s raiment to pledge  thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down   
   for that  is  his covering only  it  is  his raiment for his skin  wherein shall he sleep  and it shall come to pass  when he crieth unto me  that i will hear  for i  am  gracious

exodus    
   thou shalt not raise a false report  put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness

  if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden  and wouldest forbear to help him  thou shalt surely help with him   
  thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause   
  keep thee far from a false matter  and the innocent and righteous slay thou not  for i will not justify the wicked   
  and thou shalt take no gift  for the gift blindeth the wise  and perverteth the words of the righteous   
  also thou shalt not oppress a stranger  for ye know the heart of a stranger  seeing ye were strangers in the land of egypt   
    and six years thou shalt sow thy land  and shalt gather in the fruits thereof   
   but the seventh  year  thou shalt let it rest and lie still  that the poor of thy people may eat  and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat  in like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard   and  with thy oliveyard   
   six days thou shalt do thy work  and on the seventh day thou shalt rest  that thine ox and thine ass may rest  and the son of thy handmaid  and the stranger  may be refreshed   
   and in all  things  that i have said unto you be circumspect  and make no mention of the name of other gods  neither let it be heard out of thy mouth   
   three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year   
   thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread   thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days  as i commanded thee  in the time appointed of the month abib  for in it thou camest out from egypt  and none shall appear before me empty    
   and the feast of harvest  the firstfruits of thy labours  which thou hast sown in the field  and the feast of ingathering   which is  in the end of the year  when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field   
   three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the lord god   
   thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread  neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning   
   the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the lord thy god  thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother s milk   
    behold  i send an angel before thee  to keep thee in the way  and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared   
   beware of him  and obey his voice  provoke him not  for he will not pardon your transgressions  for my name  is  in him   
   but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice  and do all that i speak  then i will be an enemy unto thine enemies  and an adversary unto thine adversaries   
   for mine angel shall go before thee  and bring thee in unto the amorites  and the hittites  and the perizzites  and the canaanites  the hivites  and the jebusites  and i will cut them off   
   thou shalt not bow down to their gods  nor serve them  nor do after their works  but thou shalt utterly overthrow them  and quite break down their images   
   and ye shall serve the lord your god  and he shall bless thy bread  and thy water  and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee   
   there shall nothing cast their young  nor be barren  in thy land  the number of thy days i will fulfil   
   i will send my fear before thee  and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come  and i will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee   
   and i will send hornets before thee  which shall drive out the hivite  the canaanite  and the hittite  from before thee   
   i will not drive them out from before thee in one year  lest the land become desolate  and the beast of the field multiply against thee   
   by little and little i will drive them out from before thee  until thou be increased  and inherit the land   
   and i will set thy bounds from the red sea even unto the sea of the philistines  and from the desert unto the river  for i will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand  and thou shalt drive them out before thee   
   thou shalt make no covenant with them  nor with their gods   
   they shall not dwell in thy land  lest they make thee sin against me  for if thou serve their gods  it will surely be a snare unto thee   
exodus    
   and he said unto moses  come up unto the lord  thou  and aaron  nadab  and abihu  and seventy of the elders of israel  and worship ye afar off   
  and moses alone shall come near the lord  but they shall not come nigh  neither shall the people go up with him

   then went up moses  and aaron  nadab  and abihu  and seventy of the elders of israel   
   and they saw the god of israel  and  there was  under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone  and as it were the body of heaven in  his  clearness   
   and upon the nobles of the children of israel he laid not his hand  also they saw god  and did eat and drink   
    and the lord said unto moses  come up to me into the mount  and be there  and i will give thee tables of stone  and a law  and commandments which i have written  that thou mayest teach them   
   and moses rose up  and his minister joshua  and moses went up into the mount of god   
   and he said unto the elders  tarry ye here for us  until we come again unto you  and  behold  aaron and hur  are  with you  if any man have any matters to do  let him come unto them   
   and moses went up into the mount  and a cloud covered the mount   
   and the glory of the lord abode upon mount sinai  and the cloud covered it six days  and the seventh day he called unto moses out of the midst of the cloud   
   and the sight of the glory of the lord  was  like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of israel   
   and moses went into the midst of the cloud  and gat him up into the mount  and moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights

exodus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  see  i have called by name bezaleel the son of uri  the son of hur  of the tribe of judah   
  and i have filled him with the spirit of god  in wisdom  and in understanding  and in knowledge  and in all manner of workmanship   
  to devise cunning works  to work in gold  and in silver  and in brass   
  and in cutting of stones  to set  them   and in carving of timber  to work in all manner of workmanship   
  and i  behold  i have given with him aholiab  the son of ahisamach  of the tribe of dan  and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted i have put wisdom  that they may make all that i have commanded thee   
  the tabernacle of the congregation  and the ark of the testimony  and the mercy seat that  is  thereupon  and all the furniture of the tabernacle   
  and the table and his furniture  and the pure candlestick with all his furniture  and the altar of incense   
  and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture  and the laver and his foot   
   and the cloths of service  and the holy garments for aaron the priest  and the garments of his sons  to minister in the priest s office   
   and the anointing oil  and sweet incense for the holy  place   according to all that i have commanded thee shall they do   
    and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak thou also unto the children of israel  saying  verily my sabbaths ye shall keep  for it  is  a sign between me and you throughout your generations  that  ye  may know that i  am  the lord that doth sanctify you   
   ye shall keep the sabbath therefore  for it  is  holy unto you  every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death  for whosoever doeth  any  work therein  that soul shall be cut off from among his people   
   six days may work be done  but in the seventh  is  the sabbath of rest  holy to the lord  whosoever doeth  any  work in the sabbath day  he shall surely be put to death   
   wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath  to observe the sabbath throughout their generations   for  a perpetual covenant   
   it  is  a sign between me and the children of israel for ever  for  in  six days the lord made heaven and earth  and on the seventh day he rested  and was refreshed   
   and he gave unto moses  when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount sinai  two tables of testimony  tables of stone  written with the finger of god   
exodus    
   and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount  the people gathered themselves together unto aaron  and said unto him  up  make us gods  which shall go before us  for  as for  this moses  the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt  we wot not what is become of him   
  and aaron said unto them  break off the golden earrings  which  are  in the ears of your wives  of your sons  and of your daughters  and bring  them  unto me   
  and all the people brake off the golden earrings which  were  in their ears  and brought  them  unto aaron   
  and he received  them  at their hand  and fashioned it with a graving tool  after he had made it a molten calf  and they said  these  be  thy gods  o israel  which brought thee up out of the land of egypt   
  and when aaron saw  it   he built an altar before it  and aaron made proclamation  and said  to morrow  is  a feast to the lord   
  and they rose up early on the morrow  and offered burnt offerings  and brought peace offerings  and the people sat down to eat and to drink  and rose up to play   
   and the lord said unto moses  go  get thee down  for thy people  which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt  have corrupted  themselves    
  they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them  they have made them a molten calf  and have worshipped it  and have sacrificed thereunto  and said  these  be  thy gods  o israel  which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt   
  and the lord said unto moses  i have seen this people  and  behold  it  is  a stiffnecked people   
   now therefore let me alone  that my wrath may wax hot against them  and that i may consume them  and i will make of thee a great nation   
   and moses besought the lord his god  and said  lord  why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people  which thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power  and with a mighty hand   
   wherefore should the egyptians speak  and say  for mischief did he bring them out  to slay them in the mountains  and to consume them from the face of the earth  turn from thy fierce wrath  and repent of this evil against thy people   
   remember abraham  isaac  and israel  thy servants  to whom thou swarest by thine own self  and saidst unto them  i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven  and all this land that i have spoken of will i give unto your seed  and they shall inherit  it  for ever   
   and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people   
    and moses turned  and went down from the mount  and the two tables of the testimony  were  in his hand  the tables  were  written on both their sides  on the one side and on the other  were  they written   
   and the tables  were  the work of god  and the writing  was  the writing of god  graven upon the tables   
   and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted  he said unto moses   there is  a noise of war in the camp   
   and he said   it is  not the voice of  them that  shout for mastery  neither  is it  the voice of  them that  cry for being overcome   but  the noise of  them that  sing do i hear   
   and it came to pass  as soon as he came nigh unto the camp  that he saw the calf  and the dancing  and moses  anger waxed hot  and he cast the tables out of his hands  and brake them beneath the mount   
   and he took the calf which they had made  and burnt  it  in the fire  and ground  it  to powder  and strawed  it  upon the water  and made the children of israel drink  of it    
    and moses said unto aaron  what did this people unto thee  that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them   
   and aaron said  let not the anger of my lord wax hot  thou knowest the people  that they  are set  on mischief   
   for they said unto me  make us gods  which shall go before us  for  as for  this moses  the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt  we wot not what is become of him   
   and i said unto them  whosoever hath any gold  let them break  it  off  so they gave  it  me  then i cast it into the fire  and there came out this calf   
   and when moses saw that the people  were  naked   for aaron had made them naked unto  their  shame among their enemies    
   then moses stood in the gate of the camp  and said  who  is  on the lord s side   let him come  unto me  and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him   
   and he said unto them  thus saith the lord god of israel  put every man his sword by his side   and  go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp  and slay every man his brother  and every man his companion  and every man his neighbour   
   and the children of levi did according to the word of moses  and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men   
   for moses had said  consecrate yourselves to day to the lord  even every man upon his son  and upon his brother  that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day   
    and it came to pass on the morrow  that moses said unto the people  ye have sinned a great sin  and now i will go up unto the lord  peradventure i shall make an atonement for your sin   
   and moses returned unto the lord  and said  oh  this people have sinned a great sin  and have made them gods of gold   
   yet now  if thou wilt forgive their sin     and if not  blot me  i pray thee  out of thy book which thou hast written   
   and the lord said unto moses  whosoever hath sinned against me  him will i blot out of my book   
   therefore now go  lead the people unto  the place  of which i have spoken unto thee  behold  mine angel shall go before thee  nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them   
   and the lord plagued the people  because they made the calf  which aaron made   
exodus    
   and the lord said unto moses  depart   and  go up hence  thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt  unto the land which i sware unto abraham  to isaac  and to jacob  saying  unto thy seed will i give it   
  and i will send an angel before thee  and i will drive out the canaanite  the amorite  and the hittite  and the perizzite  the hivite  and the jebusite   
  unto a land flowing with milk and honey  for i will not go up in the midst of thee  for thou  art  a stiffnecked people  lest i consume thee in the way   
  and when the people heard these evil tidings  they mourned  and no man did put on him his ornaments   
  for the lord had said unto moses  say unto the children of israel  ye  are  a stiffnecked people  i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment  and consume thee  therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee  that i may know what to do unto thee   
  and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount horeb   
   and moses took the tabernacle  and pitched it without the camp  afar off from the camp  and called it the tabernacle of the congregation  and it came to pass   that  every one which sought the lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation  which  was  without the camp   
  and it came to pass  when moses went out unto the tabernacle   that  all the people rose up  and stood every man  at  his tent door  and looked after moses  until he was gone into the tabernacle   
  and it came to pass  as moses entered into the tabernacle  the cloudy pillar descended  and stood  at  the door of the tabernacle  and  the lord  talked with moses   
   and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand  at  the tabernacle door  and all the people rose up and worshipped  every man  in  his tent door   
   and the lord spake unto moses face to face  as a man speaketh unto his friend  and he turned again into the camp  but his servant joshua  the son of nun  a young man  departed not out of the tabernacle   
    and moses said unto the lord  see  thou sayest unto me  bring up this people  and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me  yet thou hast said  i know thee by name  and thou hast also found grace in my sight   
   now therefore  i pray thee  if i have found grace in thy sight  shew me now thy way  that i may know thee  that i may find grace in thy sight  and consider that this nation  is  thy people   
   and he said  my presence shall go  with thee   and i will give thee rest   
   and he said unto him  if thy presence go not  with me   carry us not up hence   
   for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight   is it  not in that thou goest with us  so shall we be separated  i and thy people  from all the people that  are  upon the face of the earth   
   and the lord said unto moses  i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken  for thou hast found grace in my sight  and i know thee by name   
   and he said  i beseech thee  shew me thy glory   
   and he said  i will make all my goodness pass before thee  and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee  and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious  and will shew mercy on whom i will shew mercy   
   and he said  thou canst not see my face  for there shall no man see me  and live   
   and the lord said  behold   there is  a place by me  and thou shalt stand upon a rock   
   and it shall come to pass  while my glory passeth by  that i will put thee in a clift of the rock  and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by   
   and i will take away mine hand  and thou shalt see my back parts  but my face shall not be seen   
exodus    
   and the lord said unto moses  hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first  and i will write upon  these  tables the words that were in the first tables  which thou brakest   
  and be ready in the morning  and come up in the morning unto mount sinai  and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount   
  and no man shall come up with thee  neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount  neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount   
  and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first  and moses rose up early in the morning  and went up unto mount sinai  as the lord had commanded him  and took in his hand the two tables of stone   
   and the lord descended in the cloud  and stood with him there  and proclaimed the name of the lord   
  and the lord passed by before him  and proclaimed  the lord  the lord god  merciful and gracious  longsuffering  and abundant in goodness and truth   
  keeping mercy for thousands  forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin  and that will by no means clear  the guilty   visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children  and upon the children s children  unto the third and to the fourth  generation    
  and moses made haste  and bowed his head toward the earth  and worshipped   
  and he said  if now i have found grace in thy sight  o lord  let my lord  i pray thee  go among us  for it  is  a stiffnecked people  and pardon our iniquity and our sin  and take us for thine inheritance   
    and he said  behold  i make a covenant  before all thy people i will do marvels  such as have not been done in all the earth  nor in any nation  and all the people among which thou  art  shall see the work of the lord  for it  is  a terrible thing that i will do with thee   
   observe thou that which i command thee this day  behold  i drive out before thee the amorite  and the canaanite  and the hittite  and the perizzite  and the hivite  and the jebusite   
   take heed to thyself  lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest  lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee   
   but ye shall destroy their altars  break their images  and cut down their groves   
   for thou shalt worship no other god  for the lord  whose name  is  jealous   is  a jealous god   
   lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land  and they go a whoring after their gods  and do sacrifice unto their gods  and  one  call thee  and thou eat of his sacrifice   
   and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons  and their daughters go a whoring after their gods  and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods   
   thou shalt make thee no molten gods   
    the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep  seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread  as i commanded thee  in the time of the month abib  for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt   
   all that openeth the matrix  is  mine  and every firstling among thy cattle   whether  ox or sheep   that is male    
   but the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb  and if thou redeem  him  not  then shalt thou break his neck  all the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem  and none shall appear before me empty   
   six days thou shalt work  but on the seventh day thou shalt rest  in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest   
   and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks  of the firstfruits of wheat harvest  and the feast of ingathering at the year s end   
   thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the lord god  the god of israel   
   for i will cast out the nations before thee  and enlarge thy borders  neither shall any man desire thy land  when thou shalt go up to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year   
   thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven  neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning   
   the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the lord thy god  thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother s milk   
   and the lord said unto moses  write thou these words  for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel   
    and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights  he did neither eat bread  nor drink water  and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant  the ten commandments   
   and it came to pass  when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tables of testimony in moses  hand  when he came down from the mount  that moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him   
   and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses  behold  the skin of his face shone  and they were afraid to come nigh him   
   and moses called unto them  and aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him  and moses talked with them   
   and afterward all the children of israel came nigh  and he gave them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount sinai   
   and  till  moses had done speaking with them  he put a vail on his face   
   but when moses went in before the lord to speak with him  he took the vail off  until he came out  and he came out  and spake unto the children of israel  that  which he was commanded   
   and the children of israel saw the face of moses  that the skin of moses  face shone  and moses put the vail upon his face again  until he went in to speak with him   
exodus    
   and moses gathered all the congregation of the children of israel together  and said unto them  these  are  the words which the lord hath commanded  that  ye  should do them   
  six days shall work be done  but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day  a sabbath of rest to the lord  whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death   
  ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day   
  and moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of israel  saying  this  is  the thing which the lord commanded  saying   
  take ye from among you an offering unto the lord  whosoever  is  of a willing heart  let him bring it  an offering of the lord  gold  and silver  and brass

   and they came  every one whose heart stirred him up  and every one whom his spirit made willing   and  they brought the lord s offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation  and for all his service  and for the holy garments   
   and they came  both men and women  as many as were willing hearted   and  brought bracelets  and earrings  and rings  and tablets  all jewels of gold  and every man that offered  offered  an offering of gold unto the lord

    and moses said unto the children of israel  see  the lord hath called by name bezaleel the son of uri  the son of hur  of the tribe of judah   
   and he hath filled him with the spirit of god  in wisdom  in understanding  and in knowledge  and in all manner of workmanship   
   and to devise curious works  to work in gold  and in silver  and in brass   
   and in the cutting of stones  to set  them   and in carving of wood  to make any manner of cunning work   
   and he hath put in his heart that he may teach   both  he  and aholiab  the son of ahisamach  of the tribe of dan

  and they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold  graven  as signets are graven  with the names of the children of israel   
  and he put them on the shoulders of the ephod   that they should be  stones for a memorial to the children of israel  as the lord commanded moses

   and they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue  that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod  and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod  as the lord commanded moses   
   and he made the robe of the ephod  of  woven work  all  of  blue   
   and  there was  an hole in the midst of the robe  as the hole of an habergeon   with  a band round about the hole  that it should not rend   
   and they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates  of  blue  and purple  and scarlet   and  twined  linen

exodus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  on the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation   
  and thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony  and cover the ark with the vail   
  and thou shalt bring in the table  and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it  and thou shalt bring in the candlestick  and light the lamps thereof   
  and thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony  and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle   
  and thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation   
  and thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar  and shalt put water therein   
  and thou shalt set up the court round about  and hang up the hanging at the court gate   
  and thou shalt take the anointing oil  and anoint the tabernacle  and all that  is  therein  and shalt hallow it  and all the vessels thereof  and it shall be holy   
   and thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering  and all his vessels  and sanctify the altar  and it shall be an altar most holy   
   and thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot  and sanctify it   
   and thou shalt bring aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  and wash them with water   
   and thou shalt put upon aaron the holy garments  and anoint him  and sanctify him  that he may minister unto me in the priest s office   
   and thou shalt bring his sons  and clothe them with coats   
   and thou shalt anoint them  as thou didst anoint their father  that they may minister unto me in the priest s office  for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations   
    thus did moses  according to all that the lord commanded him  so did he   
   and it came to pass in the first month in the second year  on the first  day  of the month   that  the tabernacle was reared up   
   and moses reared up the tabernacle  and fastened his sockets  and set up the boards thereof  and put in the bars thereof  and reared up his pillars   
   and he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle  and put the covering of the tent above upon it  as the lord commanded moses   
   and he took and put the testimony into the ark  and set the staves on the ark  and put the mercy seat above upon the ark   
   and he brought the ark into the tabernacle  and set up the vail of the covering  and covered the ark of the testimony  as the lord commanded moses   
   and he put the table in the tent of the congregation  upon the side of the tabernacle northward  without the vail   
   and he set the bread in order upon it before the lord  as the lord had commanded moses   
   and he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation  over against the table  on the side of the tabernacle southward   
   and he lighted the lamps before the lord  as the lord commanded moses   
   and he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail   
   and he burnt sweet incense thereon  as the lord commanded moses   
   and he set up the hanging  at  the door of the tabernacle   
   and he put the altar of burnt offering  by  the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation  and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering  as the lord commanded moses   
   and he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar  and put water there  to wash  withal    
   and moses and aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat   
   when they went into the tent of the congregation  and when they came near unto the altar  they washed  as the lord commanded moses   
   and he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar  and set up the hanging of the court gate  so moses finished the work   
    then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation  and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle   
   and moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation  because the cloud abode thereon  and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle   
   and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle  the children of israel went onward in all their journeys   
   but if the cloud were not taken up  then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up   
   for the cloud of the lord  was  upon the tabernacle by day  and fire was on it by night  in the sight of all the house of israel  throughout all their journeys

   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  command aaron and his sons  saying  this  is  the law of the burnt offering  it  is  the burnt offering  because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning  and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it   
   and the priest shall put on his linen garment  and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh  and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar  and he shall put them beside the altar   
   and he shall put off his garments  and put on other garments  and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place   
   and the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it  it shall not be put out  and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning  and lay the burnt offering in order upon it  and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings   
   the fire shall ever be burning upon the altar  it shall never go out   
    and this  is  the law of the meat offering  the sons of aaron shall offer it before the lord  before the altar   
   and he shall take of it his handful  of the flour of the meat offering  and of the oil thereof  and all the frankincense which  is  upon the meat offering  and shall burn  it  upon the altar  for  a sweet savour   even  the memorial of it  unto the lord   
   and the remainder thereof shall aaron and his sons eat  with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place  in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it   
   it shall not be baken with leaven  i have given it  unto them for  their portion of my offerings made by fire  it  is  most holy  as  is  the sin offering  and as the trespass offering   
   all the males among the children of aaron shall eat of it   it shall be  a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the lord made by fire  every one that toucheth them shall be holy   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   this  is  the offering of aaron and of his sons  which they shall offer unto the lord in the day when he is anointed  the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual  half of it in the morning  and half thereof at night   
   in a pan it shall be made with oil   and when it is  baken  thou shalt bring it in   and  the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer  for  a sweet savour unto the lord   
   and the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it   it is  a statute for ever unto the lord  it shall be wholly burnt   
   for every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt  it shall not be eaten   
    and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto aaron and to his sons  saying  this  is  the law of the sin offering  in the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the lord  it  is  most holy   
   the priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it  in the holy place shall it be eaten  in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation   
   whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy  and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment  thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place   
   but the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken  and if it be sodden in a brasen pot  it shall be both scoured  and rinsed in water   
   all the males among the priests shall eat thereof  it  is  most holy   
   and no sin offering  whereof  any  of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile  withal  in the holy  place   shall be eaten  it shall be burnt in the fire   
leviticus   
   likewise this  is  the law of the trespass offering  it  is  most holy   
  in the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering  and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar   
  and he shall offer of it all the fat thereof  the rump  and the fat that covereth the inwards   
  and the two kidneys  and the fat that  is  on them  which  is  by the flanks  and the caul  that is  above the liver  with the kidneys  it shall he take away   
  and the priest shall burn them upon the altar  for  an offering made by fire unto the lord  it  is  a trespass offering   
  every male among the priests shall eat thereof  it shall be eaten in the holy place  it  is  most holy   
  as the sin offering  is   so  is  the trespass offering   there is  one law for them  the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have  it    
  and the priest that offereth any man s burnt offering   even  the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered   
  and all the meat offering that is baken in the oven  and all that is dressed in the fryingpan  and in the pan  shall be the priest s that offereth it   
   and every meat offering  mingled with oil  and dry  shall all the sons of aaron have  one  as much  as another   
    and this  is  the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings  which he shall offer unto the lord   
   if he offer it for a thanksgiving  then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil  and unleavened wafers anointed with oil  and cakes mingled with oil  of fine flour  fried   
   besides the cakes  he shall offer  for  his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings   
   and of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation  for  an heave offering unto the lord   and  it shall be the priest s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings   
   and the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered  he shall not leave any of it until the morning   
   but if the sacrifice of his offering  be  a vow  or a voluntary offering  it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice  and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten   
   but the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire   
   and if  any  of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day  it shall not be accepted  neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it  it shall be an abomination  and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity   
   and the flesh that toucheth any unclean  thing  shall not be eaten  it shall be burnt with fire  and as for the flesh  all that be clean shall eat thereof   
   but the soul that eateth  of  the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings  that  pertain  unto the lord  having his uncleanness upon him  even that soul shall be cut off from his people   
   moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean  thing  as  the uncleanness of man  or  any  unclean beast  or any abominable unclean  thing   and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings  which  pertain  unto the lord  even that soul shall be cut off from his people   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto the children of israel  saying  ye shall eat no manner of fat  of ox  or of sheep  or of goat   
   and the fat of the beast that dieth of itself  and the fat of that which is torn with beasts  may be used in any other use  but ye shall in no wise eat of it   
   for whosoever eateth the fat of the beast  of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the lord  even the soul that eateth  it  shall be cut off from his people   
   moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood   whether it be  of fowl or of beast  in any of your dwellings   
   whatsoever soul  it be  that eateth any manner of blood  even that soul shall be cut off from his people   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto the children of israel  saying  he that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the lord shall bring his oblation unto the lord of the sacrifice of his peace offerings   
   his own hands shall bring the offerings of the lord made by fire  the fat with the breast  it shall he bring  that the breast may be waved  for  a wave offering before the lord   
   and the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar  but the breast shall be aaron s and his sons    
   and the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest  for  an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings   
   he among the sons of aaron  that offereth the blood of the peace offerings  and the fat  shall have the right shoulder for  his  part   
   for the wave breast and the heave shoulder have i taken of the children of israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings  and have given them unto aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of israel   
    this  is the portion  of the anointing of aaron  and of the anointing of his sons  out of the offerings of the lord made by fire  in the day  when  he presented them to minister unto the lord in the priest s office   
   which the lord commanded to be given them of the children of israel  in the day that he anointed them   by  a statute for ever throughout their generations   
   this  is  the law of the burnt offering  of the meat offering  and of the sin offering  and of the trespass offering  and of the consecrations  and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings   
   which the lord commanded moses in mount sinai  in the day that he commanded the children of israel to offer their oblations unto the lord  in the wilderness of sinai   
leviticus   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  take aaron and his sons with him  and the garments  and the anointing oil  and a bullock for the sin offering  and two rams  and a basket of unleavened bread   
  and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation   
  and moses did as the lord commanded him  and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation   
  and moses said unto the congregation  this  is  the thing which the lord commanded to be done   
  and moses brought aaron and his sons  and washed them with water   
  and he put upon him the coat  and girded him with the girdle  and clothed him with the robe  and put the ephod upon him  and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod  and bound  it  unto him therewith   
  and he put the breastplate upon him  also he put in the breastplate the urim and the thummim   
  and he put the mitre upon his head  also upon the mitre   even  upon his forefront  did he put the golden plate  the holy crown  as the lord commanded moses   
   and moses took the anointing oil  and anointed the tabernacle and all that  was  therein  and sanctified them   
   and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times  and anointed the altar and all his vessels  both the laver and his foot  to sanctify them   
   and he poured of the anointing oil upon aaron s head  and anointed him  to sanctify him   
   and moses brought aaron s sons  and put coats upon them  and girded them with girdles  and put bonnets upon them  as the lord commanded moses   
    and he brought the bullock for the sin offering  and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering   
   and he slew  it   and moses took the blood  and put  it  upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger  and purified the altar  and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar  and sanctified it  to make reconciliation upon it   
   and he took all the fat that  was  upon the inwards  and the caul  above  the liver  and the two kidneys  and their fat  and moses burned  it  upon the altar   
   but the bullock  and his hide  his flesh  and his dung  he burnt with fire without the camp  as the lord commanded moses   
   and he brought the ram for the burnt offering  and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram   
   and he killed  it   and moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about   
   and he cut the ram into pieces  and moses burnt the head  and the pieces  and the fat   
   and he washed the inwards and the legs in water  and moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar  it  was  a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour   and  an offering made by fire unto the lord  as the lord commanded moses   
   and he brought the other ram  the ram of consecration  and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram   
   and he slew  it   and moses took of the blood of it  and put  it  upon the tip of aaron s right ear  and upon the thumb of his right hand  and upon the great toe of his right foot   
   and he brought aaron s sons  and moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear  and upon the thumbs of their right hands  and upon the great toes of their right feet  and moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about   
   and he took the fat  and the rump  and all the fat that  was  upon the inwards  and the caul  above  the liver  and the two kidneys  and their fat  and the right shoulder   
   and out of the basket of unleavened bread  that  was  before the lord  he took one unleavened cake  and a cake of oiled bread  and one wafer  and put  them  on the fat  and upon the right shoulder   
   and he put all upon aaron s hands  and upon his sons  hands  and waved them  for  a wave offering before the lord   
   and moses took them from off their hands  and burnt  them  on the altar upon the burnt offering  they  were  consecrations for a sweet savour  it  is  an offering made by fire unto the lord   
   and moses took the breast  and waved it  for  a wave offering before the lord   for  of the ram of consecration it was moses  part  as the lord commanded moses   
   and moses took of the anointing oil  and of the blood which  was  upon the altar  and sprinkled  it  upon aaron   and  upon his garments  and upon his sons  and upon his sons  garments with him  and sanctified aaron   and  his garments  and his sons  and his sons  garments with him   
    and moses said unto aaron and to his sons  boil the flesh  at  the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  and there eat it with the bread that  is  in the basket of consecrations  as i commanded  saying  aaron and his sons shall eat it   
   and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire   
   and ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  in  seven days  until the days of your consecration be at an end  for seven days shall he consecrate you   
   as he hath done this day   so  the lord hath commanded to do  to make an atonement for you   
   therefore shall ye abide  at  the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days  and keep the charge of the lord  that ye die not  for so i am commanded   
   so aaron and his sons did all things which the lord commanded by the hand of moses   
leviticus   
   and it came to pass on the eighth day   that  moses called aaron and his sons  and the elders of israel   
  and he said unto aaron  take thee a young calf for a sin offering  and a ram for a burnt offering  without blemish  and offer  them  before the lord   
  and unto the children of israel thou shalt speak  saying  take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering  and a calf and a lamb   both  of the first year  without blemish  for a burnt offering   
  also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings  to sacrifice before the lord  and a meat offering mingled with oil  for to day the lord will appear unto you   
  and they brought  that  which moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation  and all the congregation drew near and stood before the lord   
  and moses said  this  is  the thing which the lord commanded that ye should do  and the glory of the lord shall appear unto you   
  and moses said unto aaron  go unto the altar  and offer thy sin offering  and thy burnt offering  and make an atonement for thyself  and for the people  and offer the offering of the people  and make an atonement for them  as the lord commanded   
   aaron therefore went unto the altar  and slew the calf of the sin offering  which  was  for himself   
  and the sons of aaron brought the blood unto him  and he dipped his finger in the blood  and put  it  upon the horns of the altar  and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar   
   but the fat  and the kidneys  and the caul above the liver of the sin offering  he burnt upon the altar  as the lord commanded moses   
   and the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp   
   and he slew the burnt offering  and aaron s sons presented unto him the blood  which he sprinkled round about upon the altar   
   and they presented the burnt offering unto him  with the pieces thereof  and the head  and he burnt  them  upon the altar   
   and he did wash the inwards and the legs  and burnt  them  upon the burnt offering on the altar   
   and he brought the people s offering  and took the goat  which  was  the sin offering for the people  and slew it  and offered it for sin  as the first   
   and he brought the burnt offering  and offered it according to the manner   
   and he brought the meat offering  and took an handful thereof  and burnt  it  upon the altar  beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning   
   he slew also the bullock and the ram  for  a sacrifice of peace offerings  which  was  for the people  and aaron s sons presented unto him the blood  which he sprinkled upon the altar round about   
   and the fat of the bullock and of the ram  the rump  and that which covereth  the inwards   and the kidneys  and the caul  above  the liver   
   and they put the fat upon the breasts  and he burnt the fat upon the altar   
   and the breasts and the right shoulder aaron waved  for  a wave offering before the lord  as moses commanded   
   and aaron lifted up his hand toward the people  and blessed them  and came down from offering of the sin offering  and the burnt offering  and peace offerings   
    and moses and aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation  and came out  and blessed the people  and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the people   
   and there came a fire out from before the lord  and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat   which  when all the people saw  they shouted  and fell on their faces   
leviticus    
   and nadab and abihu  the sons of aaron  took either of them his censer  and put fire therein  and put incense thereon  and offered strange fire before the lord  which he commanded them not   
  and there went out fire from the lord  and devoured them  and they died before the lord   
   then moses said unto aaron  this  is it  that the lord spake  saying  i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me  and before all the people i will be glorified  and aaron held his peace   
  and moses called mishael and elzaphan  the sons of uzziel the uncle of aaron  and said unto them  come near  carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp   
  so they went near  and carried them in their coats out of the camp  as moses had said   
  and moses said unto aaron  and unto eleazar and unto ithamar  his sons  uncover not your heads  neither rend your clothes  lest ye die  and lest wrath come upon all the people  but let your brethren  the whole house of israel  bewail the burning which the lord hath kindled   
  and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  lest ye die  for the anointing oil of the lord  is  upon you  and they did according to the word of moses   
   and the lord spake unto aaron  saying   
  do not drink wine nor strong drink  thou  nor thy sons with thee  when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation  lest ye die   it shall be  a statute for ever throughout your generations   
   and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy  and between unclean and clean   
   and that ye may teach the children of israel all the statutes which the lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of moses   
    and moses spake unto aaron  and unto eleazar and unto ithamar  his sons that were left  take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the lord made by fire  and eat it without leaven beside the altar  for it  is  most holy   
   and ye shall eat it in the holy place  because it  is  thy due  and thy sons  due  of the sacrifices of the lord made by fire  for so i am commanded   
   and the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place  thou  and thy sons  and thy daughters with thee  for  they be  thy due  and thy sons  due   which  are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of israel   
   the heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat  to wave  it for  a wave offering before the lord  and it shall be thine  and thy sons  with thee  by a statute for ever  as the lord hath commanded   
   and moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering  and  behold  it was burnt  and he was angry with eleazar and ithamar  the sons of aaron  which were  left  alive   saying   
   wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place  seeing it  is  most holy  and  god  hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation  to make atonement for them before the lord   
   behold  the blood of it was not brought in within the holy  place   ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy  place   as i commanded   
   and aaron said unto moses  behold  this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the lord  and such things have befallen me  and  if  i had eaten the sin offering to day  should it have been accepted in the sight of the lord   
   and when moses heard  that   he was content   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron  saying unto them   
  speak unto the children of israel  saying  these  are  the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that  are  on the earth   
  whatsoever parteth the hoof  and is clovenfooted   and  cheweth the cud  among the beasts  that shall ye eat   
  nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud  or of them that divide the hoof   as  the camel  because he cheweth the cud  but divideth not the hoof  he  is  unclean unto you   
  and the coney  because he cheweth the cud  but divideth not the hoof  he  is  unclean unto you   
  and the hare  because he cheweth the cud  but divideth not the hoof  he  is  unclean unto you   
  and the swine  though he divide the hoof  and be clovenfooted  yet he cheweth not the cud  he  is  unclean to you   
  of their flesh shall ye not eat  and their carcase shall ye not touch  they  are  unclean to you   
   these shall ye eat of all that  are  in the waters  whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters  in the seas  and in the rivers  them shall ye eat   
   and all that have not fins and scales in the seas  and in the rivers  of all that move in the waters  and of any living thing which  is  in the waters  they  shall be  an abomination unto you   
   they shall be even an abomination unto you  ye shall not eat of their flesh  but ye shall have their carcases in abomination   
   whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters  that  shall be  an abomination unto you   
   and these  are they which  ye shall have in abomination among the fowls  they shall not be eaten  they  are  an abomination  the eagle  and the ossifrage  and the ospray   
   and the vulture  and the kite after his kind   
   every raven after his kind   
   and the owl  and the night hawk  and the cuckow  and the hawk after his kind   
   and the little owl  and the cormorant  and the great owl   
   and the swan  and the pelican  and the gier eagle   
   and the stork  the heron after her kind  and the lapwing  and the bat   
    all fowls that creep  going upon  all  four   shall be  an abomination unto you   
   yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon  all  four  which have legs above their feet  to leap withal upon the earth   
    even  these of them ye may eat  the locust after his kind  and the bald locust after his kind  and the beetle after his kind  and the grasshopper after his kind   
   but all  other  flying creeping things  which have four feet   shall be  an abomination unto you   
   and for these ye shall be unclean  whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even   
   and whosoever beareth  ought  of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes  and be unclean until the even   
    the carcases  of every beast which divideth the hoof  and  is  not clovenfooted  nor cheweth the cud   are  unclean unto you  every one that toucheth them shall be unclean   
   and whatsoever goeth upon his paws  among all manner of beasts that go on  all  four  those  are  unclean unto you  whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even   
   and he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes  and be unclean until the even  they  are  unclean unto you   
   these also  shall be  unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth  the weasel  and the mouse  and the tortoise after his kind   
   and the ferret  and the chameleon  and the lizard  and the snail  and the mole   
   these  are  unclean to you among all that creep  whosoever doth touch them  when they be dead  shall be unclean until the even   
   and upon whatsoever  any  of them  when they are dead  doth fall  it shall be unclean  whether  it be  any vessel of wood  or raiment  or skin  or sack  whatsoever vessel  it be   wherein  any  work is done  it must be put into water  and it shall be unclean until the even  so it shall be cleansed   
   and every earthen vessel  whereinto  any  of them falleth  whatsoever  is  in it shall be unclean  and ye shall break it   
   of all meat which may be eaten   that  on which  such  water cometh shall be unclean  and all drink that may be drunk in every  such  vessel shall be unclean   
   and every  thing  whereupon  any part  of their carcase falleth shall be unclean   whether it be  oven  or ranges for pots  they shall be broken down   for  they  are  unclean  and shall be unclean unto you   
   nevertheless a fountain or pit   wherein there is  plenty of water  shall be clean  but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean   
   and if  any part  of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown  it  shall be  clean   
   but if  any  water be put upon the seed  and  any part  of their carcase fall thereon  it  shall be  unclean unto you   
   and if any beast  of which ye may eat  die  he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even   
   and he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes  and be unclean until the even  he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes  and be unclean until the even   
   and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth  shall be  an abomination  it shall not be eaten   
   whatsoever goeth upon the belly  and whatsoever goeth upon  all  four  or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth  them ye shall not eat  for they  are  an abomination   
    ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth  neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them  that ye should be defiled thereby   
   for i  am  the lord your god  ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves  and ye shall be holy  for i  am  holy  neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth   
   for i  am  the lord that bringeth you up out of the land of egypt  to be your god  ye shall therefore be holy  for i  am  holy   
   this  is  the law of the beasts  and of the fowl  and of every living creature that moveth in the waters  and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth   
   to make a difference between the unclean and the clean  and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  speak unto the children of israel  saying  if a woman have conceived seed  and born a man child  then she shall be unclean seven days  according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean   
  and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised   
  and she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days  she shall touch no hallowed thing  nor come into the sanctuary  until the days of her purifying be fulfilled   
  but if she bear a maid child  then she shall be unclean two weeks  as in her separation  and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days   
   and when the days of her purifying are fulfilled  for a son  or for a daughter  she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering  and a young pigeon  or a turtledove  for a sin offering  unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  unto the priest   
  who shall offer it before the lord  and make an atonement for her  and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood  this  is  the law for her that hath born a male or a female   
  and if she be not able to bring a lamb  then she shall bring two turtles  or two young pigeons  the one for the burnt offering  and the other for a sin offering  and the priest shall make an atonement for her  and she shall be clean   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses and aaron  saying   
  when a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising  a scab  or bright spot  and it be in the skin of his flesh  like  the plague of leprosy  then he shall be brought unto aaron the priest  or unto one of his sons the priests   
  and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh  and  when  the hair in the plague is turned white  and the plague in sight  be  deeper than the skin of his flesh  it  is  a plague of leprosy  and the priest shall look on him  and pronounce him unclean   
  if the bright spot  be  white in the skin of his flesh  and in sight  be  not deeper than the skin  and the hair thereof be not turned white  then the priest shall shut up  him that hath  the plague seven days   
  and the priest shall look on him the seventh day  and  behold   if  the plague in his sight be at a stay   and  the plague spread not in the skin  then the priest shall shut him up seven days more   
  and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day  and  behold   if  the plague  be  somewhat dark   and  the plague spread not in the skin  the priest shall pronounce him clean  it  is but  a scab  and he shall wash his clothes  and be clean   
  but if the scab spread much abroad in the skin  after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing  he shall be seen of the priest again   
  and  if  the priest see that  behold  the scab spreadeth in the skin  then the priest shall pronounce him unclean  it  is  a leprosy   
  when the plague of leprosy is in a man  then he shall be brought unto the priest   
   and the priest shall see  him   and  behold   if  the rising  be  white in the skin  and it have turned the hair white  and  there be  quick raw flesh in the rising   
   it  is  an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh  and the priest shall pronounce him unclean  and shall not shut him up  for he  is  unclean   
   and if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin  and the leprosy cover all the skin of  him that hath  the plague from his head even to his foot  wheresoever the priest looketh   
   then the priest shall consider  and  behold   if  the leprosy have covered all his flesh  he shall pronounce  him  clean  that hath  the plague  it is all turned white  he  is  clean   
   but when raw flesh appeareth in him  he shall be unclean   
   and the priest shall see the raw flesh  and pronounce him to be unclean   for  the raw flesh  is  unclean  it  is  a leprosy   
   or if the raw flesh turn again  and be changed unto white  he shall come unto the priest   
   and the priest shall see him  and  behold   if  the plague be turned into white  then the priest shall pronounce  him  clean  that hath  the plague  he  is  clean   
    the flesh also  in which   even  in the skin thereof  was a boil  and is healed   
   and in the place of the boil there be a white rising  or a bright spot  white  and somewhat reddish  and it be shewed to the priest   
   and if  when the priest seeth it  behold  it  be  in sight lower than the skin  and the hair thereof be turned white  the priest shall pronounce him unclean  it  is  a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil   
   but if the priest look on it  and  behold   there be  no white hairs therein  and  if  it  be  not lower than the skin  but  be  somewhat dark  then the priest shall shut him up seven days   
   and if it spread much abroad in the skin  then the priest shall pronounce him unclean  it  is  a plague   
   but if the bright spot stay in his place   and  spread not  it  is  a burning boil  and the priest shall pronounce him clean   
   or if there be  any  flesh  in the skin whereof  there is  a hot burning  and the quick  flesh  that burneth have a white bright spot  somewhat reddish  or white   
   then the priest shall look upon it  and  behold   if  the hair in the bright spot be turned white  and it  be in  sight deeper than the skin  it  is  a leprosy broken out of the burning  wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean  it  is  the plague of leprosy   
   but if the priest look on it  and  behold   there be  no white hair in the bright spot  and it  be  no lower than the  other  skin  but  be  somewhat dark  then the priest shall shut him up seven days   
   and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day   and  if it be spread much abroad in the skin  then the priest shall pronounce him unclean  it  is  the plague of leprosy   
   and if the bright spot stay in his place   and  spread not in the skin  but it  be  somewhat dark  it  is  a rising of the burning  and the priest shall pronounce him clean  for it  is  an inflammation of the burning   
   if a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard   
   then the priest shall see the plague  and  behold  if it  be  in sight deeper than the skin   and there be  in it a yellow thin hair  then the priest shall pronounce him unclean  it  is  a dry scall   even  a leprosy upon the head or beard   
   and if the priest look on the plague of the scall  and  behold  it  be  not in sight deeper than the skin  and  that there is  no black hair in it  then the priest shall shut up  him that hath  the plague of the scall seven days   
   and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague  and  behold   if  the scall spread not  and there be in it no yellow hair  and the scall  be  not in sight deeper than the skin   
   he shall be shaven  but the scall shall he not shave  and the priest shall shut up  him that hath  the scall seven days more   
   and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall  and  behold   if  the scall be not spread in the skin  nor  be  in sight deeper than the skin  then the priest shall pronounce him clean  and he shall wash his clothes  and be clean   
   but if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing   
   then the priest shall look on him  and  behold  if the scall be spread in the skin  the priest shall not seek for yellow hair  he  is  unclean   
   but if the scall be in his sight at a stay  and  that  there is black hair grown up therein  the scall is healed  he  is  clean  and the priest shall pronounce him clean   
    if a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots   even  white bright spots   
   then the priest shall look  and  behold   if  the bright spots in the skin of their flesh  be  darkish white  it  is  a freckled spot  that  groweth in the skin  he  is  clean   
   and the man whose hair is fallen off his head  he  is  bald   yet is  he clean   
   and he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face  he  is  forehead bald   yet is  he clean   
   and if there be in the bald head  or bald forehead  a white reddish sore  it  is  a leprosy sprung up in his bald head  or his bald forehead   
   then the priest shall look upon it  and  behold   if  the rising of the sore  be  white reddish in his bald head  or in his bald forehead  as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh   
   he is a leprous man  he  is  unclean  the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean  his plague  is  in his head   
   and the leper in whom the plague  is   his clothes shall be rent  and his head bare  and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip  and shall cry  unclean  unclean   
   all the days wherein the plague  shall be  in him he shall be defiled  he  is  unclean  he shall dwell alone  without the camp  shall  his habitation  be    
    the garment also that the plague of leprosy is in   whether it be  a woollen garment  or a linen garment   
   whether  it be  in the warp  or woof  of linen  or of woollen  whether in a skin  or in any thing made of skin   
   and if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment  or in the skin  either in the warp  or in the woof  or in any thing of skin  it  is  a plague of leprosy  and shall be shewed unto the priest   
   and the priest shall look upon the plague  and shut up  it that hath  the plague seven days   
   and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day  if the plague be spread in the garment  either in the warp  or in the woof  or in a skin   or  in any work that is made of skin  the plague  is  a fretting leprosy  it  is  unclean   
   he shall therefore burn that garment  whether warp or woof  in woollen or in linen  or any thing of skin  wherein the plague is  for it  is  a fretting leprosy  it shall be burnt in the fire   
   and if the priest shall look  and  behold  the plague be not spread in the garment  either in the warp  or in the woof  or in any thing of skin   
   then the priest shall command that they wash  the thing  wherein the plague  is   and he shall shut it up seven days more   
   and the priest shall look on the plague  after that it is washed  and  behold   if  the plague have not changed his colour  and the plague be not spread  it  is  unclean  thou shalt burn it in the fire  it  is  fret inward   whether  it  be  bare within or without   
   and if the priest look  and  behold  the plague  be  somewhat dark after the washing of it  then he shall rend it out of the garment  or out of the skin  or out of the warp  or out of the woof   
   and if it appear still in the garment  either in the warp  or in the woof  or in any thing of skin  it  is  a spreading  plague   thou shalt burn that wherein the plague  is  with fire   
   and the garment  either warp  or woof  or whatsoever thing of skin  it be   which thou shalt wash  if the plague be departed from them  then it shall be washed the second time  and shall be clean   
   this  is  the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen  either in the warp  or woof  or any thing of skins  to pronounce it clean  or to pronounce it unclean   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  this shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing  he shall be brought unto the priest   
  and the priest shall go forth out of the camp  and the priest shall look  and  behold   if  the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper   
  then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive  and  clean  and cedar wood  and scarlet  and hyssop   
  and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water   
  as for the living bird  he shall take it  and the cedar wood  and the scarlet  and the hyssop  and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird  that was  killed over the running water   
  and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times  and shall pronounce him clean  and shall let the living bird loose into the open field   
  and he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes  and shave off all his hair  and wash himself in water  that he may be clean  and after that he shall come into the camp  and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days   
  but it shall be on the seventh day  that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows  even all his hair he shall shave off  and he shall wash his clothes  also he shall wash his flesh in water  and he shall be clean   
    and on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish  and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish  and three tenth deals of fine flour  for  a meat offering  mingled with oil  and one log of oil   
   and the priest that maketh  him  clean shall present the man that is to be made clean  and those things  before the lord   at  the door of the tabernacle of the congregation   
   and the priest shall take one he lamb  and offer him for a trespass offering  and the log of oil  and wave them  for  a wave offering before the lord   
   and he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering  in the holy place  for as the sin offering  is  the priest s   so is  the trespass offering  it  is  most holy   
   and the priest shall take  some  of the blood of the trespass offering  and the priest shall put  it  upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed  and upon the thumb of his right hand  and upon the great toe of his right foot   
   and the priest shall take  some  of the log of oil  and pour  it  into the palm of his own left hand   
   and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that  is  in his left hand  and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the lord   
   and of the rest of the oil that  is  in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed  and upon the thumb of his right hand  and upon the great toe of his right foot  upon the blood of the trespass offering   
   and the remnant of the oil that  is  in the priest s hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed  and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the lord   
   and the priest shall offer the sin offering  and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness  and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering   
   and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar  and the priest shall make an atonement for him  and he shall be clean   
    and if he  be  poor  and cannot get so much  then he shall take one lamb  for  a trespass offering to be waved  to make an atonement for him  and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering  and a log of oil   
   and two turtledoves  or two young pigeons  such as he is able to get  and the one shall be a sin offering  and the other a burnt offering

   and he shall offer the one of the turtledoves  or of the young pigeons  such as he can get   
    even  such as he is able to get  the one  for  a sin offering  and the other  for  a burnt offering  with the meat offering  and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the lord   
   this  is  the law  of him  in whom  is  the plague of leprosy  whose hand is not able to get  that which pertaineth  to his cleansing   
    and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron  saying   
   when ye be come into the land of canaan  which i give to you for a possession  and i put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession   
   and he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest  saying  it seemeth to me  there is  as it were a plague in the house   
   then the priest shall command that they empty the house  before the priest go  into it  to see the plague  that all that  is  in the house be not made unclean  and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house   
   and he shall look on the plague  and  behold   if  the plague  be  in the walls of the house with hollow strakes  greenish or reddish  which in sight  are  lower than the wall   
   then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house  and shut up the house seven days   
   and the priest shall come again the seventh day  and shall look  and  behold   if  the plague be spread in the walls of the house   
   then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague  is   and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city   
   and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about  and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place   
   and they shall take other stones  and put  them  in the place of those stones  and he shall take other morter  and shall plaister the house   
   and if the plague come again  and break out in the house  after that he hath taken away the stones  and after he hath scraped the house  and after it is plaistered   
   then the priest shall come and look  and  behold   if  the plague be spread in the house  it  is  a fretting leprosy in the house  it  is  unclean   
   and he shall break down the house  the stones of it  and the timber thereof  and all the morter of the house  and he shall carry  them  forth out of the city into an unclean place   
   moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even   
   and he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes  and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes   
   and if the priest shall come in  and look  upon it   and  behold  the plague hath not spread in the house  after the house was plaistered  then the priest shall pronounce the house clean  because the plague is healed   
   and he shall take to cleanse the house two birds  and cedar wood  and scarlet  and hyssop   
   and he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water   
   and he shall take the cedar wood  and the hyssop  and the scarlet  and the living bird  and dip them in the blood of the slain bird  and in the running water  and sprinkle the house seven times   
   and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird  and with the running water  and with the living bird  and with the cedar wood  and with the hyssop  and with the scarlet   
   but he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields  and make an atonement for the house  and it shall be clean   
    this  is  the law for all manner of plague of leprosy  and scall   
   and for the leprosy of a garment  and of a house   
   and for a rising  and for a scab  and for a bright spot   
   to teach when  it is  unclean  and when  it is  clean  this  is  the law of leprosy   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron  saying   
  speak unto the children of israel  and say unto them  when any man hath a running issue out of his flesh   because of  his issue he  is  unclean   
  and this shall be his uncleanness in his issue  whether his flesh run with his issue  or his flesh be stopped from his issue  it  is  his uncleanness   
  every bed  whereon he lieth that hath the issue  is unclean  and every thing  whereon he sitteth  shall be unclean

   and whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even  and he that beareth  any of  those things shall wash his clothes  and bathe  himself  in water  and be unclean until the even   
   and whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue  and hath not rinsed his hands in water  he shall wash his clothes  and bathe  himself  in water  and be unclean until the even   
   and the vessel of earth  that he toucheth which hath the issue  shall be broken  and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water   
   and when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue  then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing  and wash his clothes  and bathe his flesh in running water  and shall be clean   
   and on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves  or two young pigeons  and come before the lord unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  and give them unto the priest   
   and the priest shall offer them  the one  for  a sin offering  and the other  for  a burnt offering  and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the lord for his issue   
   and if any man s seed of copulation go out from him  then he shall wash all his flesh in water  and be unclean until the even   
   and every garment  and every skin  whereon is the seed of copulation  shall be washed with water  and be unclean until the even   
   the woman also with whom man shall lie  with  seed of copulation  they shall  both  bathe  themselves  in water  and be unclean until the even   
    and if a woman have an issue   and  her issue in her flesh be blood  she shall be put apart seven days  and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even

   and if any man lie with her at all  and her flowers be upon him  he shall be unclean seven days  and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean   
   and if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation  or if it run beyond the time of her separation  all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation  she  shall be  unclean

   thus shall ye separate the children of israel from their uncleanness  that they die not in their uncleanness  when they defile my tabernacle that  is  among them   
   this  is  the law of him that hath an issue  and  of him  whose seed goeth from him  and is defiled therewith   
   and of her that is sick of her flowers  and of him that hath an issue  of the man  and of the woman  and of him that lieth with her that is unclean   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses after the death of the two sons of aaron  when they offered before the lord  and died   
  and the lord said unto moses  speak unto aaron thy brother  that he come not at all times into the holy  place  within the vail before the mercy seat  which  is  upon the ark  that he die not  for i will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat   
  thus shall aaron come into the holy  place   with a young bullock for a sin offering  and a ram for a burnt offering   
  he shall put on the holy linen coat  and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh  and shall be girded with a linen girdle  and with the linen mitre shall he be attired  these  are  holy garments  therefore shall he wash his flesh in water  and  so  put them on   
   and he shall take of the congregation of the children of israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering  and one ram for a burnt offering   
  and aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering  which  is  for himself  and make an atonement for himself  and for his house   
  and he shall take the two goats  and present them before the lord  at  the door of the tabernacle of the congregation   
  and aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats  one lot for the lord  and the other lot for the scapegoat   
  and aaron shall bring the goat upon which the lord s lot fell  and offer him  for  a sin offering   
   but the goat  on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat  shall be presented alive before the lord  to make an atonement with him   and  to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness   
   and aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering  which  is  for himself  and shall make an atonement for himself  and for his house  and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which  is  for himself   
   and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the lord  and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small  and bring  it  within the vail   
   and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the lord  that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that  is  upon the testimony  that he die not   
   and he shall take of the blood of the bullock  and sprinkle  it  with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward  and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times   
    then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering  that  is  for the people  and bring his blood within the vail  and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock  and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat  and before the mercy seat   
   and he shall make an atonement for the holy  place   because of the uncleanness of the children of israel  and because of their transgressions in all their sins  and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation  that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness   
   and there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy  place   until he come out  and have made an atonement for himself  and for his household  and for all the congregation of israel   
   and he shall go out unto the altar that  is  before the lord  and make an atonement for it  and shall take of the blood of the bullock  and of the blood of the goat  and put  it  upon the horns of the altar round about   
   and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times  and cleanse it  and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of israel   
    and when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy  place   and the tabernacle of the congregation  and the altar  he shall bring the live goat   
   and aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat  and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of israel  and all their transgressions in all their sins  putting them upon the head of the goat  and shall send  him  away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness   
   and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited  and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness   
   and aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation  and shall put off the linen garments  which he put on when he went into the holy  place   and shall leave them there   
   and he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place  and put on his garments  and come forth  and offer his burnt offering  and the burnt offering of the people  and make an atonement for himself  and for the people   
   and the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar   
   and he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes  and bathe his flesh in water  and afterward come into the camp   
   and the bullock  for  the sin offering  and the goat  for  the sin offering  whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy  place   shall  one  carry forth without the camp  and they shall burn in the fire their skins  and their flesh  and their dung   
   and he that burneth them shall wash his clothes  and bathe his flesh in water  and afterward he shall come into the camp   
    and  this  shall be a statute for ever unto you   that  in the seventh month  on the tenth  day  of the month  ye shall afflict your souls  and do no work at all   whether it be  one of your own country  or a stranger that sojourneth among you   
   for on that day shall  the priest  make an atonement for you  to cleanse you   that  ye may be clean from all your sins before the lord   
   it  shall be  a sabbath of rest unto you  and ye shall afflict your souls  by a statute for ever   
   and the priest  whom he shall anoint  and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest s office in his father s stead  shall make the atonement  and shall put on the linen clothes   even  the holy garments   
   and he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary  and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation  and for the altar  and he shall make an atonement for the priests  and for all the people of the congregation   
   and this shall be an everlasting statute unto you  to make an atonement for the children of israel for all their sins once a year  and he did as the lord commanded moses   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  speak unto aaron  and unto his sons  and unto all the children of israel  and say unto them  this  is  the thing which the lord hath commanded  saying   
  what man soever  there be  of the house of israel  that killeth an ox  or lamb  or goat  in the camp  or that killeth  it  out of the camp   
  and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  to offer an offering unto the lord before the tabernacle of the lord  blood shall be imputed unto that man  he hath shed blood  and that man shall be cut off from among his people   
  to the end that the children of israel may bring their sacrifices  which they offer in the open field  even that they may bring them unto the lord  unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  unto the priest  and offer them  for  peace offerings unto the lord   
  and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the lord  at  the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the lord   
  and they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils  after whom they have gone a whoring  this shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations   
  and thou shalt say unto them  whatsoever man  there be  of the house of israel  or of the strangers which sojourn among you  that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice   
  and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  to offer it unto the lord  even that man shall be cut off from among his people   
    and whatsoever man  there be  of the house of israel  or of the strangers that sojourn among you  that eateth any manner of blood  i will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood  and will cut him off from among his people   
   for the life of the flesh  is  in the blood  and i have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls  for it  is  the blood  that  maketh an atonement for the soul   
   therefore i said unto the children of israel  no soul of you shall eat blood  neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood   
   and whatsoever man  there be  of the children of israel  or of the strangers that sojourn among you  which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten  he shall even pour out the blood thereof  and cover it with dust   
   for  it is  the life of all flesh  the blood of it  is  for the life thereof  therefore i said unto the children of israel  ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh  for the life of all flesh  is  the blood thereof  whosoever eateth it shall be cut off   
   and every soul that eateth that which died  of itself   or that which was torn  with beasts  whether it be  one of your own country  or a stranger  he shall both wash his clothes  and bathe  himself  in water  and be unclean until the even  then shall he be clean   
   but if he wash  them  not  nor bathe his flesh  then he shall bear his iniquity   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  speak unto the children of israel  and say unto them  i am the lord your god   
  after the doings of the land of egypt  wherein ye dwelt  shall ye not do  and after the doings of the land of canaan  whither i bring you  shall ye not do  neither shall ye walk in their ordinances   
  ye shall do my judgments  and keep mine ordinances  to walk therein  i  am  the lord your god   
  ye shall therefore keep my statutes  and my judgments  which if a man do  he shall live in them  i  am  the lord   
   none of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him  to uncover  their  nakedness  i  am  the lord   
  the nakedness of thy father  or the nakedness of thy mother  shalt thou not uncover  she  is  thy mother  thou shalt not uncover her nakedness   
  the nakedness of thy father s wife shalt thou not uncover  it  is  thy father s nakedness   
  the nakedness of thy sister  the daughter of thy father  or daughter of thy mother   whether she be  born at home  or born abroad   even  their nakedness thou shalt not uncover   
   the nakedness of thy son s daughter  or of thy daughter s daughter   even  their nakedness thou shalt not uncover  for theirs  is  thine own nakedness   
   the nakedness of thy father s wife s daughter  begotten of thy father  she  is  thy sister  thou shalt not uncover her nakedness   
   thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father s sister  she  is  thy father s near kinswoman

   thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter  neither shalt thou take her son s daughter  or her daughter s daughter  to uncover her nakedness   for  they  are  her near kinswomen  it  is  wickedness   
   neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister  to vex  her   to uncover her nakedness  beside the other in her life  time    
    also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness  as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness   
   moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour s wife  to defile thyself with her   
   and thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through  the fire  to molech  neither shalt thou profane the name of thy god  i  am  the lord   
   thou shalt not lie with mankind  as with womankind  it  is  abomination   
   neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith  neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto  it  is  confusion   
   defile not ye yourselves in any of these things  for in all these the nations are defiled which i cast out before you   
   and the land is defiled  therefore i do visit the iniquity thereof upon it  and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants   
   ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments  and shall not commit  any  of these abominations   neither  any of your own nation  nor any stranger that sojourneth among you   
    for all these abominations have the men of the land done  which  were  before you  and the land is defiled    
   that the land spue not you out also  when ye defile it  as it spued out the nations that  were  before you   
   for whosoever shall commit any of these abominations  even the souls that commit  them  shall be cut off from among their people   
   therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance  that  ye  commit not  any one  of these abominable customs  which were committed before you  and that ye defile not yourselves therein  i  am  the lord your god   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  speak unto all the congregation of the children of israel  and say unto them  ye shall be holy  for i the lord your god  am  holy   
  ye shall fear every man his mother  and his father  and keep my sabbaths  i  am  the lord your god   
  turn ye not unto idols  nor make to yourselves molten gods  i  am  the lord your god   
  and if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord  ye shall offer it at your own will   
  it shall be eaten the same day ye offer it  and on the morrow  and if ought remain until the third day  it shall be burnt in the fire   
  and if it be eaten at all on the third day  it  is  abominable  it shall not be accepted   
  therefore  every one  that eateth it shall bear his iniquity  because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the lord  and that soul shall be cut off from among his people   
  and when ye reap the harvest of your land  thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field  neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest   
   and thou shalt not glean thy vineyard  neither shalt thou gather  every  grape of thy vineyard  thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger  i  am  the lord your god   
    ye shall not steal  neither deal falsely  neither lie one to another

    ye shall keep my statutes  thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind  thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed  neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee   
   and whosoever lieth carnally with a woman  that  is  a bondmaid  betrothed to an husband  and not at all redeemed  nor freedom given her  she shall be scourged  they shall not be put to death  because she was not free   
   and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the lord  unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation   even  a ram for a trespass offering   
   and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the lord for his sin which he hath done  and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him   
   and when ye shall come into the land  and shall have planted all manner of trees for food  then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised  three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you  it shall not be eaten of   
   but in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the lord  withal    
   and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof  that it may yield unto you the increase thereof  i  am  the lord your god   
   ye shall not eat  any thing  with the blood  neither shall ye use enchantment  nor observe times

   do not prostitute thy daughter  to cause her to be a whore  lest the land fall to whoredom  and the land become full of wickedness   
    ye shall keep my sabbaths  and reverence my sanctuary  i  am  the lord   
   regard not them that have familiar spirits  neither seek after wizards  to be defiled by them  i  am  the lord your god   
   thou shalt rise up before the hoary head  and honour the face of the old man  and fear thy god  i  am  the lord   
   and if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land  ye shall not vex him   
    but  the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you  and thou shalt love him as thyself  for ye were strangers in the land of egypt  i  am  the lord your god   
   ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment  in meteyard  in weight  or in measure   
   just balances  just weights  a just ephah  and a just hin  shall ye have  i  am  the lord your god  which brought you out of the land of egypt   
   therefore shall ye observe all my statutes  and all my judgments  and do them  i  am  the lord   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  again  thou shalt say to the children of israel  whosoever  he be  of the children of israel  or of the strangers that sojourn in israel  that giveth  any  of his seed unto molech  he shall surely be put to death  the people of the land shall stone him with stones   
  and i will set my face against that man  and will cut him off from among his people  because he hath given of his seed unto molech  to defile my sanctuary  and to profane my holy name   
  and if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man  when he giveth of his seed unto molech  and kill him not   
  then i will set my face against that man  and against his family  and will cut him off  and all that go a whoring after him  to commit whoredom with molech  from among their people   
  and the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits  and after wizards  to go a whoring after them  i will even set my face against that soul  and will cut him off from among his people   
  sanctify yourselves therefore  and be ye holy  for i  am  the lord your god   
  and ye shall keep my statutes  and do them  i  am  the lord which sanctify you   
  for every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death  he hath cursed his father or his mother  his blood  shall be  upon him   
    and the man that committeth adultery with  another  man s wife   even he  that committeth adultery with his neighbour s wife  the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death   
   and the man that lieth with his father s wife hath uncovered his father s nakedness  both of them shall surely be put to death  their blood  shall be  upon them   
   and if a man lie with his daughter in law  both of them shall surely be put to death  they have wrought confusion  their blood  shall be  upon them   
   if a man also lie with mankind  as he lieth with a woman  both of them have committed an abomination  they shall surely be put to death  their blood  shall be  upon them   
   and if a man take a wife and her mother  it  is  wickedness  they shall be burnt with fire  both he and they  that there be no wickedness among you   
   and if a man lie with a beast  he shall surely be put to death  and ye shall slay the beast   
   and if a woman approach unto any beast  and lie down thereto  thou shalt kill the woman  and the beast  they shall surely be put to death  their blood  shall be  upon them   
   and if a man shall take his sister  his father s daughter  or his mother s daughter  and see her nakedness  and she see his nakedness  it  is  a wicked thing  and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people  he hath uncovered his sister s nakedness  he shall bear his iniquity   
   and if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness  and shall uncover her nakedness  he hath discovered her fountain  and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood  and both of them shall be cut off from among their people

   and if a man shall take his brother s wife  it  is  an unclean thing  he hath uncovered his brother s nakedness  they shall be childless   
    ye shall therefore keep all my statutes  and all my judgments  and do them  that the land  whither i bring you to dwell therein  spue you not out   
   and ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation  which i cast out before you  for they committed all these things  and therefore i abhorred them   
   but i have said unto you  ye shall inherit their land  and i will give it unto you to possess it  a land that floweth with milk and honey  i  am  the lord your god  which have separated you from  other  people   
   ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean  and between unclean fowls and clean  and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast  or by fowl  or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground  which i have separated from you as unclean   
   and ye shall be holy unto me  for i the lord  am  holy  and have severed you from  other  people  that ye should be mine   
   a man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit  or that is a wizard  shall surely be put to death  they shall stone them with stones  their blood  shall be  upon them   
leviticus    
   and the lord said unto moses  speak unto the priests the sons of aaron  and say unto them  there shall none be defiled for the dead among his people   
  but for his kin  that is near unto him   that is   for his mother  and for his father  and for his son  and for his daughter  and for his brother   
  and for his sister a virgin  that is nigh unto him  which hath had no husband  for her may he be defiled   
   but  he shall not defile himself   being  a chief man among his people  to profane himself   
  they shall not make baldness upon their head  neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard  nor make any cuttings in their flesh   
  they shall be holy unto their god  and not profane the name of their god  for the offerings of the lord made by fire   and  the bread of their god  they do offer  therefore they shall be holy   
  they shall not take a wife  that is  a whore  or profane  neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband  for he  is  holy unto his god   
  thou shalt sanctify him therefore  for he offereth the bread of thy god  he shall be holy unto thee  for i the lord  which sanctify you   am  holy   
  and the daughter of any priest  if she profane herself by playing the whore  she profaneth her father  she shall be burnt with fire   
    and  he that is  the high priest among his brethren  upon whose head the anointing oil was poured  and that is consecrated to put on the garments  shall not uncover his head  nor rend his clothes   
   neither shall he go in to any dead body  nor defile himself for his father  or for his mother   
   neither shall he go out of the sanctuary  nor profane the sanctuary of his god  for the crown of the anointing oil of his god  is  upon him  i  am  the lord   
   and he shall take a wife in her virginity   
   a widow  or a divorced woman  or profane   or  an harlot  these shall he not take  but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife   
   neither shall he profane his seed among his people  for i the lord do sanctify him   
    and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto aaron  saying  whosoever  he be  of thy seed in their generations that hath  any  blemish  let him not approach to offer the bread of his god   
   for whatsoever man  he be  that hath a blemish  he shall not approach  a blind man  or a lame  or he that hath a flat nose  or any thing superfluous   
   or a man that is brokenfooted  or brokenhanded   
   or crookbackt  or a dwarf  or that hath a blemish in his eye  or be scurvy  or scabbed  or hath his stones broken   
   no man that hath a blemish of the seed of aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the lord made by fire  he hath a blemish  he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his god   
   he shall eat the bread of his god   both  of the most holy  and of the holy   
   only he shall not go in unto the vail  nor come nigh unto the altar  because he hath a blemish  that he profane not my sanctuaries  for i the lord do sanctify them   
   and moses told  it  unto aaron  and to his sons  and unto all the children of israel   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  speak unto aaron and to his sons  that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of israel  and that they profane not my holy name  in those things  which they hallow unto me  i  am  the lord   
  say unto them  whosoever  he be  of all your seed among your generations  that goeth unto the holy things  which the children of israel hallow unto the lord  having his uncleanness upon him  that soul shall be cut off from my presence  i  am  the lord   
  what man soever of the seed of aaron  is  a leper  or hath a running issue  he shall not eat of the holy things  until he be clean  and whoso toucheth any thing  that is  unclean  by  the dead  or a man whose seed goeth from him   
  or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing  whereby he may be made unclean  or a man of whom he may take uncleanness  whatsoever uncleanness he hath   
  the soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even  and shall not eat of the holy things  unless he wash his flesh with water   
  and when the sun is down  he shall be clean  and shall afterward eat of the holy things  because it  is  his food   
  that which dieth of itself  or is torn  with beasts   he shall not eat to defile himself therewith  i  am  the lord   
  they shall therefore keep mine ordinance  lest they bear sin for it  and die therefore  if they profane it  i the lord do sanctify them   
    there shall no stranger eat  of  the holy thing  a sojourner of the priest  or an hired servant  shall not eat  of  the holy thing   
   but if the priest buy  any  soul with his money  he shall eat of it  and he that is born in his house  they shall eat of his meat   
   if the priest s daughter also be  married  unto a stranger  she may not eat of an offering of the holy things   
   but if the priest s daughter be a widow  or divorced  and have no child  and is returned unto her father s house  as in her youth  she shall eat of her father s meat  but there shall no stranger eat thereof   
   and if a man eat  of  the holy thing unwittingly  then he shall put the fifth  part  thereof unto it  and shall give  it  unto the priest with the holy thing   
   and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of israel  which they offer unto the lord   
   or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass  when they eat their holy things  for i the lord do sanctify them   
    and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto aaron  and to his sons  and unto all the children of israel  and say unto them  whatsoever  he be  of the house of israel  or of the strangers in israel  that will offer his oblation for all his vows  and for all his freewill offerings  which they will offer unto the lord for a burnt offering   
    ye shall offer  at your own will a male without blemish  of the beeves  of the sheep  or of the goats   
    but  whatsoever hath a blemish   that  shall ye not offer  for it shall not be acceptable for you   
   and whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord to accomplish  his  vow  or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep  it shall be perfect to be accepted  there shall be no blemish therein   
   blind  or broken  or maimed  or having a wen  or scurvy  or scabbed  ye shall not offer these unto the lord  nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the lord   
   either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts  that mayest thou offer  for  a freewill offering  but for a vow it shall not be accepted   
   ye shall not offer unto the lord that which is bruised  or crushed  or broken  or cut  neither shall ye make  any offering thereof  in your land   
   neither from a stranger s hand shall ye offer the bread of your god of any of these  because their corruption  is  in them   and  blemishes  be  in them  they shall not be accepted for you   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   when a bullock  or a sheep  or a goat  is brought forth  then it shall be seven days under the dam  and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the lord   
   and  whether it be  cow or ewe  ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day   
   and when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the lord  offer  it  at your own will   
   on the same day it shall be eaten up  ye shall leave none of it until the morrow  i  am  the lord   
   therefore shall ye keep my commandments  and do them  i  am  the lord   
   neither shall ye profane my holy name  but i will be hallowed among the children of israel  i  am  the lord which hallow you   
   that brought you out of the land of egypt  to be your god  i  am  the lord   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying

   also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month  when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land  ye shall keep a feast unto the lord seven days  on the first day  shall be  a sabbath  and on the eighth day  shall be  a sabbath   
   and ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees  branches of palm trees  and the boughs of thick trees  and willows of the brook  and ye shall rejoice before the lord your god seven days   
   and ye shall keep it a feast unto the lord seven days in the year   it shall be  a statute for ever in your generations  ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month   
   ye shall dwell in booths seven days  all that are israelites born shall dwell in booths   
   that your generations may know that i made the children of israel to dwell in booths  when i brought them out of the land of egypt  i  am  the lord your god   
   and moses declared unto the children of israel the feasts of the lord   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  command the children of israel  that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light  to cause the lamps to burn continually   
  without the vail of the testimony  in the tabernacle of the congregation  shall aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the lord continually   it shall be  a statute for ever in your generations   
  he shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the lord continually   
  and thou shalt take fine flour  and bake twelve cakes thereof  two tenth deals shall be in one cake   
  and thou shalt set them in two rows  six on a row  upon the pure table before the lord   
  and thou shalt put pure frankincense upon  each  row  that it may be on the bread for a memorial   even  an offering made by fire unto the lord   
  every sabbath he shall set it in order before the lord continually   being taken  from the children of israel by an everlasting covenant   
  and it shall be aaron s and his sons   and they shall eat it in the holy place  for it  is  most holy unto him of the offerings of the lord made by fire by a perpetual statute   
    and the son of an israelitish woman  whose father  was  an egyptian  went out among the children of israel  and this son of the israelitish  woman  and a man of israel strove together in the camp   
   and the israelitish woman s son blasphemed the name  of the lord   and cursed  and they brought him unto moses   and his mother s name  was  shelomith  the daughter of dibri  of the tribe of dan    
   and they put him in ward  that the mind of the lord might be shewed them   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp  and let all that heard  him  lay their hands upon his head  and let all the congregation stone him   
   and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel  saying  whosoever curseth his god shall bear his sin   
   and he that blasphemeth the name of the lord  he shall surely be put to death   and  all the congregation shall certainly stone him  as well the stranger  as he that is born in the land  when he blasphemeth the name  of the lord   shall be put to death   
   and he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death   
   and he that killeth a beast shall make it good  beast for beast   
   and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour  as he hath done  so shall it be done to him   
   breach for breach  eye for eye  tooth for tooth  as he hath caused a blemish in a man  so shall it be done to him  again    
   and he that killeth a beast  he shall restore it  and he that killeth a man  he shall be put to death   
   ye shall have one manner of law  as well for the stranger  as for one of your own country  for i  am  the lord your god   
   and moses spake to the children of israel  that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp  and stone him with stones  and the children of israel did as the lord commanded moses   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses in mount sinai  saying   
  speak unto the children of israel  and say unto them  when ye come into the land which i give you  then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord   
  six years thou shalt sow thy field  and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard  and gather in the fruit thereof   
  but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land  a sabbath for the lord  thou shalt neither sow thy field  nor prune thy vineyard   
  that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap  neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed   for  it is a year of rest unto the land   
  and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you  for thee  and for thy servant  and for thy maid  and for thy hired servant  and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee   
  and for thy cattle  and for the beast that  are  in thy land  shall all the increase thereof be meat   
   and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee  seven times seven years  and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years   
  then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth  day  of the seventh month  in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land   
   and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year  and proclaim liberty throughout  all  the land unto all the inhabitants thereof  it shall be a jubile unto you  and ye shall return every man unto his possession  and ye shall return every man unto his family   
   a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you  ye shall not sow  neither reap that which groweth of itself in it  nor gather  the grapes  in it of thy vine undressed   
   for it  is  the jubile  it shall be holy unto you  ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field   
   in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession   
   and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour  or buyest  ought  of thy neighbour s hand  ye shall not oppress one another   
   according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour   and  according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee   
   according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof  and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it  for  according  to the number  of the years  of the fruits doth he sell unto thee   
   ye shall not therefore oppress one another  but thou shalt fear thy god  for i  am  the lord your god   
   wherefore ye shall do my statutes  and keep my judgments  and do them  and ye shall dwell in the land in safety   
   and the land shall yield her fruit  and ye shall eat your fill  and dwell therein in safety   
   and if ye shall say  what shall we eat the seventh year  behold  we shall not sow  nor gather in our increase   
   then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year  and it shall bring forth fruit for three years   
   and ye shall sow the eighth year  and eat  yet  of old fruit until the ninth year  until her fruits come in ye shall eat  of  the old  store    
    the land shall not be sold for ever  for the land  is  mine  for ye  are  strangers and sojourners with me   
   and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land   
   if thy brother be waxen poor  and hath sold away  some  of his possession  and if any of his kin come to redeem it  then shall he redeem that which his brother sold   
   and if the man have none to redeem it  and himself be able to redeem it   
   then let him count the years of the sale thereof  and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it  that he may return unto his possession   
   but if he be not able to restore  it  to him  then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile  and in the jubile it shall go out  and he shall return unto his possession   
   and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city  then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold   within  a full year may he redeem it   
   and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year  then the house that  is  in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations  it shall not go out in the jubile   
   but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country  they may be redeemed  and they shall go out in the jubile   
   notwithstanding the cities of the levites   and  the houses of the cities of their possession  may the levites redeem at any time   
   and if a man purchase of the levites  then the house that was sold  and the city of his possession  shall go out in  the year of  jubile  for the houses of the cities of the levites  are  their possession among the children of israel   
   but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold  for it  is  their perpetual possession   
   and if thy brother be waxen poor  and fallen in decay with thee  then thou shalt relieve him   yea  though he be  a stranger  or a sojourner  that he may live with thee   
   take thou no usury of him  or increase  but fear thy god  that thy brother may live with thee   
   thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury  nor lend him thy victuals for increase   
   i  am  the lord your god  which brought you forth out of the land of egypt  to give you the land of canaan   and  to be your god   
    and if thy brother  that dwelleth  by thee be waxen poor  and be sold unto thee  thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant   
    but  as an hired servant   and  as a sojourner  he shall be with thee   and  shall serve thee unto the year of jubile   
   and  then  shall he depart from thee   both  he and his children with him  and shall return unto his own family  and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return   
   for they  are  my servants  which i brought forth out of the land of egypt  they shall not be sold as bondmen   
   thou shalt not rule over him with rigour  but shalt fear thy god   
   both thy bondmen  and thy bondmaids  which thou shalt have   shall be  of the heathen that are round about you  of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids   
   moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you  of them shall ye buy  and of their families that  are  with you  which they begat in your land  and they shall be your possession   
   and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you  to inherit  them for  a possession  they shall be your bondmen for ever  but over your brethren the children of israel  ye shall not rule one over another with rigour   
   and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee  and thy brother  that dwelleth  by him wax poor  and sell himself unto the stranger  or  sojourner by thee  or to the stock of the stranger s family   
   after that he is sold he may be redeemed again  one of his brethren may redeem him   
   either his uncle  or his uncle s son  may redeem him  or  any  that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him  or if he be able  he may redeem himself   
   and he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile  and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years  according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him   
   if  there be  yet many years  behind   according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for   
   and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile  then he shall count with him   and  according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption   
    and  as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him   and the other  shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight   
   and if he be not redeemed in these  years   then he shall go out in the year of jubile   both  he  and his children with him   
   for unto me the children of israel  are  servants  they  are  my servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt  i  am  the lord your god   
leviticus    
   ye shall make you no idols nor graven image  neither rear you up a standing image  neither shall ye set up  any  image of stone in your land  to bow down unto it  for i  am  the lord your god   
  ye shall keep my sabbaths  and reverence my sanctuary  i  am  the lord   
  if ye walk in my statutes  and keep my commandments  and do them   
  then i will give you rain in due season  and the land shall yield her increase  and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit   
  and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage  and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time  and ye shall eat your bread to the full  and dwell in your land safely   
  and i will give peace in the land  and ye shall lie down  and none shall make  you  afraid  and i will rid evil beasts out of the land  neither shall the sword go through your land   
  and ye shall chase your enemies  and they shall fall before you by the sword   
  and five of you shall chase an hundred  and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight  and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword   
  for i will have respect unto you  and make you fruitful  and multiply you  and establish my covenant with you   
   and ye shall eat old store  and bring forth the old because of the new   
   and i will set my tabernacle among you  and my soul shall not abhor you   
   and i will walk among you  and will be your god  and ye shall be my people   
   i  am  the lord your god  which brought you forth out of the land of egypt  that ye should not be their bondmen  and i have broken the bands of your yoke  and made you go upright   
    but if ye will not hearken unto me  and will not do all these commandments   
   and if ye shall despise my statutes  or if your soul abhor my judgments  so that ye will not do all my commandments   but  that ye break my covenant   
   i also will do this unto you  i will even appoint over you terror  consumption  and the burning ague  that shall consume the eyes  and cause sorrow of heart  and ye shall sow your seed in vain  for your enemies shall eat it   
   and i will set my face against you  and ye shall be slain before your enemies  they that hate you shall reign over you  and ye shall flee when none pursueth you   
   and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me  then i will punish you seven times more for your sins   
   and i will break the pride of your power  and i will make your heaven as iron  and your earth as brass   
   and your strength shall be spent in vain  for your land shall not yield her increase  neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits   
   and if ye walk contrary unto me  and will not hearken unto me  i will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins   
   i will also send wild beasts among you  which shall rob you of your children  and destroy your cattle  and make you few in number  and your  high  ways shall be desolate   
   and if ye will not be reformed by me by these things  but will walk contrary unto me   
   then will i also walk contrary unto you  and will punish you yet seven times for your sins   
   and i will bring a sword upon you  that shall avenge the quarrel of  my  covenant  and when ye are gathered together within your cities  i will send the pestilence among you  and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy   
    and  when i have broken the staff of your bread  ten women shall bake your bread in one oven  and they shall deliver  you  your bread again by weight  and ye shall eat  and not be satisfied   
   and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me  but walk contrary unto me   
   then i will walk contrary unto you also in fury  and i  even i  will chastise you seven times for your sins   
   and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons  and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat   
   and i will destroy your high places  and cut down your images  and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols  and my soul shall abhor you   
   and i will make your cities waste  and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation  and i will not smell the savour of your sweet odours   
   and i will bring the land into desolation  and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it   
   and i will scatter you among the heathen  and will draw out a sword after you  and your land shall be desolate  and your cities waste   
   then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths  as long as it lieth desolate  and ye  be  in your enemies  land   even  then shall the land rest  and enjoy her sabbaths   
   as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest  because it did not rest in your sabbaths  when ye dwelt upon it   
   and upon them that are left  alive  of you i will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies  and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them  and they shall flee  as fleeing from a sword  and they shall fall when none pursueth   
   and they shall fall one upon another  as it were before a sword  when none pursueth  and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies   
   and ye shall perish among the heathen  and the land of your enemies shall eat you up   
   and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies  lands  and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them   
    if they shall confess their iniquity  and the iniquity of their fathers  with their trespass which they trespassed against me  and that also they have walked contrary unto me   
   and  that  i also have walked contrary unto them  and have brought them into the land of their enemies  if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled  and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity   
   then will i remember my covenant with jacob  and also my covenant with isaac  and also my covenant with abraham will i remember  and i will remember the land   
   the land also shall be left of them  and shall enjoy her sabbaths  while she lieth desolate without them  and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity  because  even because they despised my judgments  and because their soul abhorred my statutes   
   and yet for all that  when they be in the land of their enemies  i will not cast them away  neither will i abhor them  to destroy them utterly  and to break my covenant with them  for i  am  the lord their god   
   but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors  whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the heathen  that i might be their god  i  am  the lord   
   these  are  the statutes and judgments and laws  which the lord made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand of moses   
leviticus    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  speak unto the children of israel  and say unto them  when a man shall make a singular vow  the persons  shall be  for the lord by thy estimation   
  and thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old  even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver  after the shekel of the sanctuary   
  and if it  be  a female  then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels   
  and if  it be  from five years old even unto twenty years old  then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels  and for the female ten shekels   
  and if  it be  from a month old even unto five years old  then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver  and for the female thy estimation  shall be  three shekels of silver   
  and if  it be  from sixty years old and above  if  it be  a male  then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels  and for the female ten shekels   
  but if he be poorer than thy estimation  then he shall present himself before the priest  and the priest shall value him  according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him   
  and if  it be  a beast  whereof men bring an offering unto the lord  all that  any man  giveth of such unto the lord shall be holy   
   he shall not alter it  nor change it  a good for a bad  or a bad for a good  and if he shall at all change beast for beast  then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy   
   and if  it be  any unclean beast  of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the lord  then he shall present the beast before the priest   
   and the priest shall value it  whether it be good or bad  as thou valuest it   who art  the priest  so shall it be   
   but if he will at all redeem it  then he shall add a fifth  part  thereof unto thy estimation   
    and when a man shall sanctify his house  to be  holy unto the lord  then the priest shall estimate it  whether it be good or bad  as the priest shall estimate it  so shall it stand   
   and if he that sanctified it will redeem his house  then he shall add the fifth  part  of the money of thy estimation unto it  and it shall be his   
   and if a man shall sanctify unto the lord  some part  of a field of his possession  then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof  an homer of barley seed  shall be valued  at fifty shekels of silver   
   if he sanctify his field from the year of jubile  according to thy estimation it shall stand   
   but if he sanctify his field after the jubile  then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain  even unto the year of the jubile  and it shall be abated from thy estimation   
   and if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it  then he shall add the fifth  part  of the money of thy estimation unto it  and it shall be assured to him   
   and if he will not redeem the field  or if he have sold the field to another man  it shall not be redeemed any more   
   but the field  when it goeth out in the jubile  shall be holy unto the lord  as a field devoted  the possession thereof shall be the priest s   
   and if  a man  sanctify unto the lord a field which he hath bought  which  is  not of the fields of his possession   
   then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation   even  unto the year of the jubile  and he shall give thine estimation in that day   as  a holy thing unto the lord   
   in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought   even  to him to whom the possession of the land  did belong    
   and all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary  twenty gerahs shall be the shekel   
    only the firstling of the beasts  which should be the lord s firstling  no man shall sanctify it  whether  it be  ox  or sheep  it  is  the lord s   
   and if  it be  of an unclean beast  then he shall redeem  it  according to thine estimation  and shall add a fifth  part  of it thereto  or if it be not redeemed  then it shall be sold according to thy estimation   
   notwithstanding no devoted thing  that a man shall devote unto the lord of all that he hath   both  of man and beast  and of the field of his possession  shall be sold or redeemed  every devoted thing  is  most holy unto the lord   
   none devoted  which shall be devoted of men  shall be redeemed   but  shall surely be put to death   
   and all the tithe of the land   whether  of the seed of the land   or  of the fruit of the tree   is  the lord s   it is  holy unto the lord   
   and if a man will at all redeem  ought  of his tithes  he shall add thereto the fifth  part  thereof   
   and concerning the tithe of the herd  or of the flock   even  of whatsoever passeth under the rod  the tenth shall be holy unto the lord   
   he shall not search whether it be good or bad  neither shall he change it  and if he change it at all  then both it and the change thereof shall be holy  it shall not be redeemed   
   these  are  the commandments  which the lord commanded moses for the children of israel in mount sinai   
 
numbers

   because all the firstborn  are  mine   for  on the day that i smote all the firstborn in the land of egypt i hallowed unto me all the firstborn in israel  both man and beast  mine shall they be  i  am  the lord

   and those that were numbered of the sons of gershon  throughout their families  and by the house of their fathers

   even those that were numbered of them after their families  were three thousand and two hundred   
   these  be  those that were numbered of the families of the sons of merari  whom moses and aaron numbered according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses   
   all those that were numbered of the levites  whom moses and aaron and the chief of israel numbered  after their families  and after the house of their fathers

   according to the commandment of the lord they were numbered by the hand of moses  every one according to his service  and according to his burden  thus were they numbered of him  as the lord commanded moses   
numbers   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  command the children of israel  that they put out of the camp every leper  and every one that hath an issue  and whosoever is defiled by the dead   
  both male and female shall ye put out  without the camp shall ye put them  that they defile not their camps  in the midst whereof i dwell   
  and the children of israel did so  and put them out without the camp  as the lord spake unto moses  so did the children of israel   
  and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  speak unto the children of israel  when a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit  to do a trespass against the lord  and that person be guilty   
  then they shall confess their sin which they have done  and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof  and add unto it the fifth  part  thereof  and give  it  unto  him  against whom he hath trespassed   
  but if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto  let the trespass be recompensed unto the lord   even  to the priest  beside the ram of the atonement  whereby an atonement shall be made for him   
  and every offering of all the holy things of the children of israel  which they bring unto the priest  shall be his   
   and every man s hallowed things shall be his  whatsoever any man giveth the priest  it shall be his   
    and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto the children of israel  and say unto them  if any man s wife go aside  and commit a trespass against him   
   and a man lie with her carnally  and it be hid from the eyes of her husband  and be kept close  and she be defiled  and  there be  no witness against her  neither she be taken  with the manner    
   and the spirit of jealousy come upon him  and he be jealous of his wife  and she be defiled  or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him  and he be jealous of his wife  and she be not defiled   
   then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest  and he shall bring her offering for her  the tenth  part  of an ephah of barley meal  he shall pour no oil upon it  nor put frankincense thereon  for it  is  an offering of jealousy  an offering of memorial  bringing iniquity to remembrance   
   and the priest shall bring her near  and set her before the lord   
   and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel  and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take  and put  it  into the water   
   and the priest shall set the woman before the lord  and uncover the woman s head  and put the offering of memorial in her hands  which  is  the jealousy offering  and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse   
   and the priest shall charge her by an oath  and say unto the woman  if no man have lain with thee  and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness  with another  instead of thy husband  be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse   
   but if thou hast gone aside  to another  instead of thy husband  and if thou be defiled  and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband   
   then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing  and the priest shall say unto the woman  the lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people  when the lord doth make thy thigh to rot  and thy belly to swell   
   and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels  to make  thy  belly to swell  and  thy  thigh to rot  and the woman shall say  amen  amen   
   and the priest shall write these curses in a book  and he shall blot  them  out with the bitter water   
   and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse  and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her   and become  bitter   
   then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman s hand  and shall wave the offering before the lord  and offer it upon the altar   
   and the priest shall take an handful of the offering   even  the memorial thereof  and burn  it  upon the altar  and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water   
   and when he hath made her to drink the water  then it shall come to pass   that   if she be defiled  and have done trespass against her husband  that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her   and become  bitter  and her belly shall swell  and her thigh shall rot  and the woman shall be a curse among her people   
   and if the woman be not defiled  but be clean  then she shall be free  and shall conceive seed   
   this  is  the law of jealousies  when a wife goeth aside  to another  instead of her husband  and is defiled   
   or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him  and he be jealous over his wife  and shall set the woman before the lord  and the priest shall execute upon her all this law   
   then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity  and this woman shall bear her iniquity   
numbers   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  speak unto the children of israel  and say unto them  when either man or woman shall separate  themselves  to vow a vow of a nazarite  to separate  themselves  unto the lord   
  he shall separate  himself  from wine and strong drink  and shall drink no vinegar of wine  or vinegar of strong drink  neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes  nor eat moist grapes  or dried   
  all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree  from the kernels even to the husk   
  all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head  until the days be fulfilled  in the which he separateth  himself  unto the lord  he shall be holy   and  shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow   
  all the days that he separateth  himself  unto the lord he shall come at no dead body   
  he shall not make himself unclean for his father  or for his mother  for his brother  or for his sister  when they die  because the consecration of his god  is  upon his head   
  all the days of his separation he  is  holy unto the lord   
  and if any man die very suddenly by him  and he hath defiled the head of his consecration  then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing  on the seventh day shall he shave it   
   and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles  or two young pigeons  to the priest  to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation   
   and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering  and the other for a burnt offering  and make an atonement for him  for that he sinned by the dead  and shall hallow his head that same day   
   and he shall consecrate unto the lord the days of his separation  and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering  but the days that were before shall be lost  because his separation was defiled   
   and this  is  the law of the nazarite  when the days of his separation are fulfilled  he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation   
   and he shall offer his offering unto the lord  one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering  and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering  and one ram without blemish for peace offerings   
   and a basket of unleavened bread  cakes of fine flour mingled with oil  and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil  and their meat offering  and their drink offerings   
   and the priest shall bring  them  before the lord  and shall offer his sin offering  and his burnt offering   
   and he shall offer the ram  for  a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord  with the basket of unleavened bread  the priest shall offer also his meat offering  and his drink offering   
   and the nazarite shall shave the head of his separation  at  the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  and shall take the hair of the head of his separation  and put  it  in the fire which  is  under the sacrifice of the peace offerings   
   and the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram  and one unleavened cake out of the basket  and one unleavened wafer  and shall put  them  upon the hands of the nazarite  after  the hair of  his separation is shaven   
   and the priest shall wave them  for  a wave offering before the lord  this  is  holy for the priest  with the wave breast and heave shoulder  and after that the nazarite may drink wine   
   this  is  the law of the nazarite who hath vowed   and of  his offering unto the lord for his separation  beside  that  that his hand shall get  according to the vow which he vowed  so he must do after the law of his separation   
    and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto aaron and unto his sons  saying  on this wise ye shall bless the children of israel  saying unto them   
   the lord bless thee  and keep thee   
   the lord make his face shine upon thee  and be gracious unto thee   
   the lord lift up his countenance upon thee  and give thee peace   
   and they shall put my name upon the children of israel  and i will bless them

numbers   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  speak unto aaron  and say unto him  when thou lightest the lamps  the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick   
  and aaron did so  he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick  as the lord commanded moses   
  and this work of the candlestick  was of  beaten gold  unto the shaft thereof  unto the flowers thereof   was  beaten work  according unto the pattern which the lord had shewed moses  so he made the candlestick   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  take the levites from among the children of israel  and cleanse them   
  and thus shalt thou do unto them  to cleanse them  sprinkle water of purifying upon them  and let them shave all their flesh  and let them wash their clothes  and  so  make themselves clean   
  then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering   even  fine flour mingled with oil  and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering   
  and thou shalt bring the levites before the tabernacle of the congregation  and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of israel together   
   and thou shalt bring the levites before the lord  and the children of israel shall put their hands upon the levites   
   and aaron shall offer the levites before the lord  for  an offering of the children of israel  that they may execute the service of the lord   
   and the levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks  and thou shalt offer the one  for  a sin offering  and the other  for  a burnt offering  unto the lord  to make an atonement for the levites   
   and thou shalt set the levites before aaron  and before his sons  and offer them  for  an offering unto the lord   
   thus shalt thou separate the levites from among the children of israel  and the levites shall be mine   
   and after that shall the levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation  and thou shalt cleanse them  and offer them  for  an offering   
   for they  are  wholly given unto me from among the children of israel  instead of such as open every womb   even instead of  the firstborn of all the children of israel  have i taken them unto me   
   for all the firstborn of the children of israel  are  mine   both  man and beast  on the day that i smote every firstborn in the land of egypt i sanctified them for myself   
   and i have taken the levites for all the firstborn of the children of israel   
   and i have given the levites  as  a gift to aaron and to his sons from among the children of israel  to do the service of the children of israel in the tabernacle of the congregation  and to make an atonement for the children of israel  that there be no plague among the children of israel  when the children of israel come nigh unto the sanctuary   
   and moses  and aaron  and all the congregation of the children of israel  did to the levites according unto all that the lord commanded moses concerning the levites  so did the children of israel unto them   
   and the levites were purified  and they washed their clothes  and aaron offered them  as  an offering before the lord  and aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them   
   and after that went the levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before aaron  and before his sons  as the lord had commanded moses concerning the levites  so did they unto them   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   this  is it  that  belongeth  unto the levites  from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation   
   and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service  thereof   and shall serve no more   
   but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation  to keep the charge  and shall do no service  thus shalt thou do unto the levites touching their charge   
numbers   
   and the lord spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai  in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of egypt  saying   
  let the children of israel also keep the passover at his appointed season   
  in the fourteenth day of this month  at even  ye shall keep it in his appointed season  according to all the rites of it  and according to all the ceremonies thereof  shall ye keep it   
  and moses spake unto the children of israel  that they should keep the passover   
  and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of sinai  according to all that the lord commanded moses  so did the children of israel   
  and there were certain men  who were defiled by the dead body of a man  that they could not keep the passover on that day  and they came before moses and before aaron on that day   
  and those men said unto him  we  are  defiled by the dead body of a man  wherefore are we kept back  that we may not offer an offering of the lord in his appointed season among the children of israel   
  and moses said unto them  stand still  and i will hear what the lord will command concerning you   
  and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto the children of israel  saying  if any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body  or  be  in a journey afar off  yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord   
   the fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it   and  eat it with unleavened bread and bitter  herbs    
   they shall leave none of it unto the morning  nor break any bone of it  according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it   
   but the man that  is  clean  and is not in a journey  and forbeareth to keep the passover  even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people  because he brought not the offering of the lord in his appointed season  that man shall bear his sin   
   and if a stranger shall sojourn among you  and will keep the passover unto the lord  according to the ordinance of the passover  and according to the manner thereof  so shall he do  ye shall have one ordinance  both for the stranger  and for him that was born in the land   
    and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle   namely   the tent of the testimony  and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire  until the morning   
   so it was alway  the cloud covered it  by day   and the appearance of fire by night   
   and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle  then after that the children of israel journeyed  and in the place where the cloud abode  there the children of israel pitched their tents   
   at the commandment of the lord the children of israel journeyed  and at the commandment of the lord they pitched  as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents   
   and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days  then the children of israel kept the charge of the lord  and journeyed not   
   and  so  it was  when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle  according to the commandment of the lord they abode in their tents  and according to the commandment of the lord they journeyed   
   and  so  it was  when the cloud abode from even unto the morning  and  that  the cloud was taken up in the morning  then they journeyed  whether  it was  by day or by night that the cloud was taken up  they journeyed   
   or  whether it were  two days  or a month  or a year  that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle  remaining thereon  the children of israel abode in their tents  and journeyed not  but when it was taken up  they journeyed   
   at the commandment of the lord they rested in the tents  and at the commandment of the lord they journeyed  they kept the charge of the lord  at the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses   
numbers    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  make thee two trumpets of silver  of a whole piece shalt thou make them  that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly  and for the journeying of the camps   
  and when they shall blow with them  all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation   
  and if they blow  but  with one  trumpet   then the princes   which are  heads of the thousands of israel  shall gather themselves unto thee   
  when ye blow an alarm  then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward   
  when ye blow an alarm the second time  then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey  they shall blow an alarm for their journeys   
  but when the congregation is to be gathered together  ye shall blow  but ye shall not sound an alarm   
  and the sons of aaron  the priests  shall blow with the trumpets  and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations   
  and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you  then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets  and ye shall be remembered before the lord your god  and ye shall be saved from your enemies   
   also in the day of your gladness  and in your solemn days  and in the beginnings of your months  ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings  and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings  that they may be to you for a memorial before your god  i  am  the lord your god   
    and it came to pass on the twentieth  day  of the second month  in the second year  that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony   
   and the children of israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of sinai  and the cloud rested in the wilderness of paran   
   and they first took their journey according to the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses   
   in the first  place  went the standard of the camp of the children of judah according to their armies  and over his host  was  nahshon the son of amminadab   
   and over the host of the tribe of the children of issachar  was  nethaneel the son of zuar   
   and over the host of the tribe of the children of zebulun  was  eliab the son of helon   
   and the tabernacle was taken down  and the sons of gershon and the sons of merari set forward  bearing the tabernacle   
   and the standard of the camp of reuben set forward according to their armies  and over his host  was  elizur the son of shedeur   
   and over the host of the tribe of the children of simeon  was  shelumiel the son of zurishaddai   
   and over the host of the tribe of the children of gad  was  eliasaph the son of deuel   
   and the kohathites set forward  bearing the sanctuary  and  the other  did set up the tabernacle against they came   
   and the standard of the camp of the children of ephraim set forward according to their armies  and over his host  was  elishama the son of ammihud   
   and over the host of the tribe of the children of manasseh  was  gamaliel the son of pedahzur   
   and over the host of the tribe of the children of benjamin  was  abidan the son of gideoni   
   and the standard of the camp of the children of dan set forward   which was  the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts  and over his host  was  ahiezer the son of ammishaddai   
   and over the host of the tribe of the children of asher  was  pagiel the son of ocran   
   and over the host of the tribe of the children of naphtali  was  ahira the son of enan   
   thus  were  the journeyings of the children of israel according to their armies  when they set forward   
    and moses said unto hobab  the son of raguel the midianite  moses  father in law  we are journeying unto the place of which the lord said  i will give it you  come thou with us  and we will do thee good  for the lord hath spoken good concerning israel   
   and he said unto him  i will not go  but i will depart to mine own land  and to my kindred   
   and he said  leave us not  i pray thee  forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness  and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes   
   and it shall be  if thou go with us  yea  it shall be  that what goodness the lord shall do unto us  the same will we do unto thee   
   and they departed from the mount of the lord three days  journey  and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them in the three days  journey  to search out a resting place for them   
   and the cloud of the lord  was  upon them by day  when they went out of the camp   
   and it came to pass  when the ark set forward  that moses said  rise up  lord  and let thine enemies be scattered  and let them that hate thee flee before thee   
   and when it rested  he said  return  o lord  unto the many thousands of israel   
numbers    
   and  when  the people complained  it displeased the lord  and the lord heard  it   and his anger was kindled  and the fire of the lord burnt among them  and consumed  them that were  in the uttermost parts of the camp   
  and the people cried unto moses  and when moses prayed unto the lord  the fire was quenched   
  and he called the name of the place taberah  because the fire of the lord burnt among them   
   and the mixt multitude that  was  among them fell a lusting  and the children of israel also wept again  and said  who shall give us flesh to eat   
  we remember the fish  which we did eat in egypt freely  the cucumbers  and the melons  and the leeks  and the onions  and the garlick   
  but now our soul  is  dried away   there is  nothing at all  beside this manna   before  our eyes   
  and the manna  was  as coriander seed  and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium   
   and  the people went about  and gathered  it   and ground  it  in mills  or beat  it  in a mortar  and baked  it  in pans  and made cakes of it  and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil   
  and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night  the manna fell upon it   
   then moses heard the people weep throughout their families  every man in the door of his tent  and the anger of the lord was kindled greatly  moses also was displeased   
   and moses said unto the lord  wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant  and wherefore have i not found favour in thy sight  that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me   
   have i conceived all this people  have i begotten them  that thou shouldest say unto me  carry them in thy bosom  as a nursing father beareth the sucking child  unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers   
   whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people  for they weep unto me  saying  give us flesh  that we may eat   
   i am not able to bear all this people alone  because  it is  too heavy for me   
   and if thou deal thus with me  kill me  i pray thee  out of hand  if i have found favour in thy sight  and let me not see my wretchedness   
    and the lord said unto moses  gather unto me seventy men of the elders of israel  whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people  and officers over them  and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation  that they may stand there with thee   
   and i will come down and talk with thee there  and i will take of the spirit which  is  upon thee  and will put  it  upon them  and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee  that thou bear  it  not thyself alone   
   and say thou unto the people  sanctify yourselves against to morrow  and ye shall eat flesh  for ye have wept in the ears of the lord  saying  who shall give us flesh to eat  for  it was  well with us in egypt  therefore the lord will give you flesh  and ye shall eat   
   ye shall not eat one day  nor two days  nor five days  neither ten days  nor twenty days   
    but  even a whole month  until it come out at your nostrils  and it be loathsome unto you  because that ye have despised the lord which  is  among you  and have wept before him  saying  why came we forth out of egypt   
   and moses said  the people  among whom i  am    are  six hundred thousand footmen  and thou hast said  i will give them flesh  that they may eat a whole month   
   shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them  to suffice them  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them  to suffice them   
   and the lord said unto moses  is the lord s hand waxed short  thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not   
    and moses went out  and told the people the words of the lord  and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people  and set them round about the tabernacle   
   and the lord came down in a cloud  and spake unto him  and took of the spirit that  was  upon him  and gave  it  unto the seventy elders  and it came to pass   that   when the spirit rested upon them  they prophesied  and did not cease   
   but there remained two  of the  men in the camp  the name of the one  was  eldad  and the name of the other medad  and the spirit rested upon them  and they  were  of them that were written  but went not out unto the tabernacle  and they prophesied in the camp   
   and there ran a young man  and told moses  and said  eldad and medad do prophesy in the camp   
   and joshua the son of nun  the servant of moses   one  of his young men  answered and said  my lord moses  forbid them   
   and moses said unto him  enviest thou for my sake  would god that all the lord s people were prophets   and  that the lord would put his spirit upon them   
   and moses gat him into the camp  he and the elders of israel   
    and there went forth a wind from the lord  and brought quails from the sea  and let  them  fall by the camp  as it were a day s journey on this side  and as it were a day s journey on the other side  round about the camp  and as it were two cubits  high  upon the face of the earth   
   and the people stood up all that day  and all  that  night  and all the next day  and they gathered the quails  he that gathered least gathered ten homers  and they spread  them  all abroad for themselves round about the camp   
   and while the flesh  was  yet between their teeth  ere it was chewed  the wrath of the lord was kindled against the people  and the lord smote the people with a very great plague   
   and he called the name of that place kibrothhattaavah  because there they buried the people that lusted   
    and  the people journeyed from kibrothhattaavah unto hazeroth  and abode at hazeroth   
numbers    
   and miriam and aaron spake against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he had married  for he had married an ethiopian woman   
  and they said  hath the lord indeed spoken only by moses  hath he not spoken also by us  and the lord heard  it    
   now the man moses  was  very meek  above all the men which  were  upon the face of the earth    
   and the lord spake suddenly unto moses  and unto aaron  and unto miriam  come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation  and they three came out   
  and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud  and stood  in  the door of the tabernacle  and called aaron and miriam  and they both came forth   
  and he said  hear now my words  if there be a prophet among you   i  the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision   and  will speak unto him in a dream   
  my servant moses  is  not so  who  is  faithful in all mine house   
  with him will i speak mouth to mouth  even apparently  and not in dark speeches  and the similitude of the lord shall he behold  wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses   
  and the anger of the lord was kindled against them  and he departed   
    and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle  and  behold  miriam  became  leprous   white  as snow  and aaron looked upon miriam  and  behold   she was  leprous   
   and aaron said unto moses  alas  my lord  i beseech thee  lay not the sin upon us  wherein we have done foolishly  and wherein we have sinned   
   let her not be as one dead  of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother s womb   
   and moses cried unto the lord  saying  heal her now  o god  i beseech thee   
   and the lord said unto moses  if her father had but spit in her face  should she not be ashamed seven days  let her be shut out from the camp seven days  and after that let her be received in  again    
   and miriam was shut out from the camp seven days  and the people journeyed not till miriam was brought in  again    
   and afterward the people removed from hazeroth  and pitched in the wilderness of paran   
numbers    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  send thou men  that they may search the land of canaan  which i give unto the children of israel  of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man  every one a ruler among them   
  and moses by the commandment of the lord sent them from the wilderness of paran  all those men  were  heads of the children of israel   
  and these  were  their names  of the tribe of reuben  shammua the son of zaccur   
  of the tribe of simeon  shaphat the son of hori   
  of the tribe of judah  caleb the son of jephunneh   
  of the tribe of issachar  igal the son of joseph   
  of the tribe of ephraim  oshea the son of nun   
  of the tribe of benjamin  palti the son of raphu   
   of the tribe of zebulun  gaddiel the son of sodi   
   of the tribe of joseph   namely   of the tribe of manasseh  gaddi the son of susi   
   of the tribe of dan  ammiel the son of gemalli   
   of the tribe of asher  sethur the son of michael   
   of the tribe of naphtali  nahbi the son of vophsi   
   of the tribe of gad  geuel the son of machi   
   these  are  the names of the men which moses sent to spy out the land  and moses called oshea the son of nun jehoshua   
   and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan  and said unto them  get you up this  way  southward  and go up into the mountain   
   and see the land  what it  is   and the people that dwelleth therein  whether they  be  strong or weak  few or many   
   and what the land  is  that they dwell in  whether it  be  good or bad  and what cities  they be  that they dwell in  whether in tents  or in strong holds   
   and what the land  is   whether it  be  fat or lean  whether there be wood therein  or not  and be ye of good courage  and bring of the fruit of the land  now the time  was  the time of the firstripe grapes   
    so they went up  and searched the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob  as men come to hamath   
   and they ascended by the south  and came unto hebron  where ahiman  sheshai  and talmai  the children of anak   were    now hebron was built seven years before zoan in egypt    
   and they came unto the brook of eshcol  and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes  and they bare it between two upon a staff  and  they brought  of the pomegranates  and of the figs   
   the place was called the brook eshcol  because of the cluster of grapes which the children of israel cut down from thence   
   and they returned from searching of the land after forty days   
    and they went and came to moses  and to aaron  and to all the congregation of the children of israel  unto the wilderness of paran  to kadesh  and brought back word unto them  and unto all the congregation  and shewed them the fruit of the land   
   and they told him  and said  we came unto the land whither thou sentest us  and surely it floweth with milk and honey  and this  is  the fruit of it   
   nevertheless the people  be  strong that dwell in the land  and the cities  are  walled   and  very great  and moreover we saw the children of anak there   
   the amalekites dwell in the land of the south  and the hittites  and the jebusites  and the amorites  dwell in the mountains  and the canaanites dwell by the sea  and by the coast of jordan   
   and caleb stilled the people before moses  and said  let us go up at once  and possess it  for we are well able to overcome it   
   but the men that went up with him said  we be not able to go up against the people  for they  are  stronger than we   
   and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel  saying  the land  through which we have gone to search it   is  a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof  and all the people that we saw in it  are  men of a great stature   
   and there we saw the giants  the sons of anak   which come  of the giants  and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers  and so we were in their sight   
numbers    
   and all the congregation lifted up their voice  and cried  and the people wept that night   
  and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron  and the whole congregation said unto them  would god that we had died in the land of egypt  or would god we had died in this wilderness   
  and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this land  to fall by the sword  that our wives and our children should be a prey  were it not better for us to return into egypt   
  and they said one to another  let us make a captain  and let us return into egypt   
   then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel   
  and joshua the son of nun  and caleb the son of jephunneh   which were  of them that searched the land  rent their clothes   
  and they spake unto all the company of the children of israel  saying  the land  which we passed through to search it   is  an exceeding good land   
  if the lord delight in us  then he will bring us into this land  and give it us  a land which floweth with milk and honey   
  only rebel not ye against the lord  neither fear ye the people of the land  for they  are  bread for us  their defence is departed from them  and the lord  is  with us  fear them not   
   but all the congregation bade stone them with stones  and the glory of the lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of israel   
    and the lord said unto moses  how long will this people provoke me  and how long will it be ere they believe me  for all the signs which i have shewed among them   
   i will smite them with the pestilence  and disinherit them  and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they   
   and moses said unto the lord  then the egyptians shall hear  it    for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them    
   and they will tell  it  to the inhabitants of this land   for  they have heard that thou lord  art  among this people  that thou lord art seen face to face  and  that  thy cloud standeth over them  and  that  thou goest before them  by day time in a pillar of a cloud  and in a pillar of fire by night   
   now  if  thou shalt kill  all  this people as one man  then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak  saying   
   because the lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them  therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness   
   and now  i beseech thee  let the power of my lord be great  according as thou hast spoken  saying   
   the lord  is  longsuffering  and of great mercy  forgiving iniquity and transgression  and by no means clearing  the guilty   visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth  generation    
   pardon  i beseech thee  the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy  and as thou hast forgiven this people  from egypt even until now   
    and the lord said  i have pardoned according to thy word   
   but  as  truly  as  i live  all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the lord   
   because all those men which have seen my glory  and my miracles  which i did in egypt and in the wilderness  and have tempted me now these ten times  and have not hearkened to my voice   
   surely they shall not see the land which i sware unto their fathers  neither shall any of them that provoked me see it   
   but my servant caleb  because he had another spirit with him  and hath followed me fully  him will i bring into the land whereinto he went  and his seed shall possess it   
    now the amalekites and the canaanites dwelt in the valley   to morrow turn you  and get you into the wilderness by the way of the red sea   
   and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron  saying   
   how long  shall i bear with  this evil congregation  which murmur against me  i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel  which they murmur against me   
   say unto them   as truly as  i live  saith the lord  as ye have spoken in mine ears  so will i do to you   
   your carcases shall fall in this wilderness  and all that were numbered of you  according to your whole number  from twenty years old and upward  which have murmured against me   
   doubtless ye shall not come into the land   concerning  which i sware to make you dwell therein  save caleb the son of jephunneh  and joshua the son of nun   
   but your little ones  which ye said should be a prey  them will i bring in  and they shall know the land which ye have despised   
   but  as for  you  your carcases  they shall fall in this wilderness   
   and your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years  and bear your whoredoms  until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness   
   after the number of the days in which ye searched the land   even  forty days  each day for a year  shall ye bear your iniquities   even  forty years  and ye shall know my breach of promise   
   i the lord have said  i will surely do it unto all this evil congregation  that are gathered together against me  in this wilderness they shall be consumed  and there they shall die   
    and the men  which moses sent to search the land  who returned  and made all the congregation to murmur against him  by bringing up a slander upon the land   
   even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land  died by the plague before the lord   
   but joshua the son of nun  and caleb the son of jephunneh   which were  of the men that went to search the land  lived  still    
   and moses told these sayings unto all the children of israel  and the people mourned greatly   
   and they rose up early in the morning  and gat them up into the top of the mountain  saying  lo  we  be here   and will go up unto the place which the lord hath promised  for we have sinned   
   and moses said  wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the lord  but it shall not prosper   
   go not up  for the lord  is  not among you  that ye be not smitten before your enemies   
   for the amalekites and the canaanites  are  there before you  and ye shall fall by the sword  because ye are turned away from the lord  therefore the lord will not be with you   
   but they presumed to go up unto the hill top  nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the lord  and moses  departed not out of the camp   
   then the amalekites came down  and the canaanites which dwelt in that hill  and smote them  and discomfited them   even  unto hormah   
numbers    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  speak unto the children of israel  and say unto them  when ye be come into the land of your habitations  which i give unto you   
  and will make an offering by fire unto the lord  a burnt offering  or a sacrifice in performing a vow  or in a freewill offering  or in your solemn feasts  to make a sweet savour unto the lord  of the herd  or of the flock   
  then shall he that offereth his offering unto the lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth  part  of an hin of oil   
  and the fourth  part  of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice  for one lamb   
  or for a ram  thou shalt prepare  for  a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third  part  of an hin of oil   
  and for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third  part  of an hin of wine   for  a sweet savour unto the lord   
  and when thou preparest a bullock  for  a burnt offering  or  for  a sacrifice in performing a vow  or peace offerings unto the lord   
  then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil   
   and thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine   for  an offering made by fire  of a sweet savour unto the lord   
   thus shall it be done for one bullock  or for one ram  or for a lamb  or a kid   
   according to the number that ye shall prepare  so shall ye do to every one according to their number   
   all that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner  in offering an offering made by fire  of a sweet savour unto the lord   
   and if a stranger sojourn with you  or whosoever  be  among you in your generations  and will offer an offering made by fire  of a sweet savour unto the lord  as ye do  so he shall do   
   one ordinance  shall be both  for you of the congregation  and also for the stranger that sojourneth  with you   an ordinance for ever in your generations  as ye  are   so shall the stranger be before the lord   
   one law and one manner shall be for you  and for the stranger that sojourneth with you   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto the children of israel  and say unto them  when ye come into the land whither i bring you   
   then it shall be  that  when ye eat of the bread of the land  ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the lord   
   ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough  for  an heave offering  as  ye do  the heave offering of the threshingfloor  so shall ye heave it   
   of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the lord an heave offering in your generations   
    and if ye have erred  and not observed all these commandments  which the lord hath spoken unto moses   
    even  all that the lord hath commanded you by the hand of moses  from the day that the lord commanded  moses   and henceforward among your generations   
   then it shall be  if  ought  be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation  that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering  for a sweet savour unto the lord  with his meat offering  and his drink offering  according to the manner  and one kid of the goats for a sin offering   
   and the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of israel  and it shall be forgiven them  for it  is  ignorance  and they shall bring their offering  a sacrifice made by fire unto the lord  and their sin offering before the lord  for their ignorance   
   and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of israel  and the stranger that sojourneth among them  seeing all the people  were  in ignorance   
   and if any soul sin through ignorance  then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering   
   and the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly  when he sinneth by ignorance before the lord  to make an atonement for him  and it shall be forgiven him   
   ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance   both for  him that is born among the children of israel  and for the stranger that sojourneth among them   
    but the soul that doeth  ought  presumptuously   whether he be  born in the land  or a stranger  the same reproacheth the lord  and that soul shall be cut off from among his people   
   because he hath despised the word of the lord  and hath broken his commandment  that soul shall utterly be cut off  his iniquity  shall be  upon him   
   and while the children of israel were in the wilderness  they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day   
   and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto moses and aaron  and unto all the congregation   
   and they put him in ward  because it was not declared what should be done to him   
   and the lord said unto moses  the man shall be surely put to death  all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp   
   and all the congregation brought him without the camp  and stoned him with stones  and he died  as the lord commanded moses   
    and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto the children of israel  and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations  and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue   
   and it shall be unto you for a fringe  that ye may look upon it  and remember all the commandments of the lord  and do them  and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes  after which ye use to go a whoring   
   that ye may remember  and do all my commandments  and be holy unto your god   
   i  am  the lord your god  which brought you out of the land of egypt  to be your god  i  am  the lord your god   
numbers    
   now korah  the son of izhar  the son of kohath  the son of levi  and dathan and abiram  the sons of eliab  and on  the son of peleth  sons of reuben  took  men    
  and they rose up before moses  with certain of the children of israel  two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly  famous in the congregation  men of renown   
  and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron  and said unto them   ye take  too much upon you  seeing all the congregation  are  holy  every one of them  and the lord  is  among them  wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord   
  and when moses heard  it   he fell upon his face   
  and he spake unto korah and unto all his company  saying  even to morrow the lord will shew who  are  his  and  who is  holy  and will cause  him  to come near unto him  even  him  whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him   
  this do  take you censers  korah  and all his company   
  and put fire therein  and put incense in them before the lord to morrow  and it shall be  that  the man whom the lord doth choose  he  shall be  holy   ye take  too much upon you  ye sons of levi   
  and moses said unto korah  hear  i pray you  ye sons of levi   
   seemeth it but  a small thing unto you  that the god of israel hath separated you from the congregation of israel  to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord  and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them   
   and he hath brought thee near  to him   and all thy brethren the sons of levi with thee  and seek ye the priesthood also   
   for which cause  both  thou and all thy company  are  gathered together against the lord  and what  is  aaron  that ye murmur against him   
    and moses sent to call dathan and abiram  the sons of eliab  which said  we will not come up   
    is it  a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey  to kill us in the wilderness  except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us   
   moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey  or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards  wilt thou put out the eyes of these men  we will not come up   
   and moses was very wroth  and said unto the lord  respect not thou their offering  i have not taken one ass from them  neither have i hurt one of them   
   and moses said unto korah  be thou and all thy company before the lord  thou  and they  and aaron  to morrow   
   and take every man his censer  and put incense in them  and bring ye before the lord every man his censer  two hundred and fifty censers  thou also  and aaron  each  of you  his censer   
   and they took every man his censer  and put fire in them  and laid incense thereon  and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with moses and aaron   
   and korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the congregation   
   and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron  saying   
   separate yourselves from among this congregation  that i may consume them in a moment   
   and they fell upon their faces  and said  o god  the god of the spirits of all flesh  shall one man sin  and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation   
    and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto the congregation  saying  get you up from about the tabernacle of korah  dathan  and abiram   
   and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram  and the elders of israel followed him   
   and he spake unto the congregation  saying  depart  i pray you  from the tents of these wicked men  and touch nothing of theirs  lest ye be consumed in all their sins   
   so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah  dathan  and abiram  on every side  and dathan and abiram came out  and stood in the door of their tents  and their wives  and their sons  and their little children   
   and moses said  hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent me to do all these works  for  i have  not  done them  of mine own mind   
   if these men die the common death of all men  or if they be visited after the visitation of all men   then  the lord hath not sent me   
   but if the lord make a new thing  and the earth open her mouth  and swallow them up  with all that  appertain  unto them  and they go down quick into the pit  then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the lord   
   and it came to pass  as he had made an end of speaking all these words  that the ground clave asunder that  was  under them   
   and the earth opened her mouth  and swallowed them up  and their houses  and all the men that  appertained  unto korah  and all  their  goods   
   they  and all that  appertained  to them  went down alive into the pit  and the earth closed upon them  and they perished from among the congregation   
   and all israel that  were  round about them fled at the cry of them  for they said  lest the earth swallow us up  also    
    and there came out a fire from the lord  and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest  that he take up the censers out of the burning  and scatter thou the fire yonder  for they are hallowed   
   the censers of these sinners against their own souls  let them make them broad plates  for  a covering of the altar  for they offered them before the lord  therefore they are hallowed  and they shall be a sign unto the children of israel   
   and eleazar the priest took the brasen censers  wherewith they that were burnt had offered  and they were made broad  plates for  a covering of the altar   
    to be  a memorial unto the children of israel  that no stranger  which  is  not of the seed of aaron  come near to offer incense before the lord  that he be not as korah  and as his company  as the lord said to him by the hand of moses   
    but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron  saying  ye have killed the people of the lord   
   and it came to pass  when the congregation was gathered against moses and against aaron  that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation  and  behold  the cloud covered it  and the glory of the lord appeared   
   and moses and aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   get you up from among this congregation  that i may consume them as in a moment  and they fell upon their faces   
   and moses said unto aaron  take a censer  and put fire therein from off the altar  and put on incense  and go quickly unto the congregation  and make an atonement for them  for there is wrath gone out from the lord  the plague is begun   
   and aaron took as moses commanded  and ran into the midst of the congregation  and  behold  the plague was begun among the people  and he put on incense  and made an atonement for the people   
   and he stood between the dead and the living  and the plague was stayed   
   now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred  beside them that died about the matter of korah   
   and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  and the plague was stayed   
numbers    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  speak unto the children of israel  and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of  their  fathers  of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods  write thou every man s name upon his rod   
  and thou shalt write aaron s name upon the rod of levi  for one rod  shall be  for the head of the house of their fathers   
  and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony  where i will meet with you   
  and it shall come to pass   that  the man s rod  whom i shall choose  shall blossom  and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel  whereby they murmur against you   
  and moses spake unto the children of israel  and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece  for each prince one  according to their fathers  houses   even  twelve rods  and the rod of aaron  was  among their rods   
  and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tabernacle of witness   
   and it came to pass  that on the morrow moses went into the tabernacle of witness  and  behold  the rod of aaron for the house of levi was budded  and brought forth buds  and bloomed blossoms  and yielded almonds   
  and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all the children of israel  and they looked  and took every man his rod   
   and the lord said unto moses  bring aaron s rod again before the testimony  to be kept for a token against the rebels  and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me  that they die not   
   and moses did  so   as the lord commanded him  so did he   
   and the children of israel spake unto moses  saying  behold  we die  we perish  we all perish   
   whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lord shall die  shall we be consumed with dying   
numbers    
   and the lord said unto aaron  thou and thy sons and thy father s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary  and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood   
  and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi  the tribe of thy father  bring thou with thee  that they may be joined unto thee  and minister unto thee  but thou and thy sons with thee  shall minister  before the tabernacle of witness   
  and they shall keep thy charge  and the charge of all the tabernacle  only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar  that neither they  nor ye also  die   
  and they shall be joined unto thee  and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation  for all the service of the tabernacle  and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you   
  and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary  and the charge of the altar  that there be no wrath any more upon the children of israel   
  and i  behold  i have taken your brethren the levites from among the children of israel  to you  they are  given  as  a gift for the lord  to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation   
  therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest s office for every thing of the altar  and within the vail  and ye shall serve  i have given your priest s office  unto you  as a service of gift  and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death   
   and the lord spake unto aaron  behold  i also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of israel  unto thee have i given them by reason of the anointing  and to thy sons  by an ordinance for ever   
  this shall be thine of the most holy things   reserved  from the fire  every oblation of theirs  every meat offering of theirs  and every sin offering of theirs  and every trespass offering of theirs  which they shall render unto me   shall be  most holy for thee and for thy sons   
   in the most holy  place  shalt thou eat it  every male shall eat it  it shall be holy unto thee   
   and this  is  thine  the heave offering of their gift  with all the wave offerings of the children of israel  i have given them unto thee  and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee  by a statute for ever  every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it   
   all the best of the oil  and all the best of the wine  and of the wheat  the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the lord  them have i given thee   
    and  whatsoever is first ripe in the land  which they shall bring unto the lord  shall be thine  every one that is clean in thine house shall eat  of  it   
   every thing devoted in israel shall be thine   
   every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh  which they bring unto the lord   whether it be  of men or beasts  shall be thine  nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem  and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem   
   and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem  according to thine estimation  for the money of five shekels  after the shekel of the sanctuary  which  is  twenty gerahs   
   but the firstling of a cow  or the firstling of a sheep  or the firstling of a goat  thou shalt not redeem  they  are  holy  thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar  and shalt burn their fat  for  an offering made by fire  for a sweet savour unto the lord   
   and the flesh of them shall be thine  as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine   
   all the heave offerings of the holy things  which the children of israel offer unto the lord  have i given thee  and thy sons and thy daughters with thee  by a statute for ever  it  is  a covenant of salt for ever before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee   
    and the lord spake unto aaron  thou shalt have no inheritance in their land  neither shalt thou have any part among them  i  am  thy part and thine inheritance among the children of israel   
   and  behold  i have given the children of levi all the tenth in israel for an inheritance  for their service which they serve   even  the service of the tabernacle of the congregation   
   neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation  lest they bear sin  and die   
   but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation  and they shall bear their iniquity   it shall be  a statute for ever throughout your generations  that among the children of israel they have no inheritance   
   but the tithes of the children of israel  which they offer  as  an heave offering unto the lord  i have given to the levites to inherit  therefore i have said unto them  among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   thus speak unto the levites  and say unto them  when ye take of the children of israel the tithes which i have given you from them for your inheritance  then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the lord   even  a tenth  part  of the tithe   
   and  this  your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you  as though  it were  the corn of the threshingfloor  and as the fulness of the winepress   
   thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all your tithes  which ye receive of the children of israel  and ye shall give thereof the lord s heave offering to aaron the priest   
   out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the lord  of all the best thereof   even  the hallowed part thereof out of it   
   therefore thou shalt say unto them  when ye have heaved the best thereof from it  then it shall be counted unto the levites as the increase of the threshingfloor  and as the increase of the winepress   
   and ye shall eat it in every place  ye and your households  for it  is  your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation   
   and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it  when ye have heaved from it the best of it  neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of israel  lest ye die   
numbers    
   and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron  saying   
  this  is  the ordinance of the law which the lord hath commanded  saying  speak unto the children of israel  that they bring thee a red heifer without spot  wherein  is  no blemish   and  upon which never came yoke   
  and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest  that he may bring her forth without the camp  and  one  shall slay her before his face   
  and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger  and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times   
  and  one  shall burn the heifer in his sight  her skin  and her flesh  and her blood  with her dung  shall he burn   
  and the priest shall take cedar wood  and hyssop  and scarlet  and cast  it  into the midst of the burning of the heifer   
  then the priest shall wash his clothes  and he shall bathe his flesh in water  and afterward he shall come into the camp  and the priest shall be unclean until the even   
  and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water  and bathe his flesh in water  and shall be unclean until the even   
  and a man  that is  clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer  and lay  them  up without the camp in a clean place  and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of separation  it  is  a purification for sin   
   and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes  and be unclean until the even  and it shall be unto the children of israel  and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them  for a statute for ever   
    he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days   
   he shall purify himself with it on the third day  and on the seventh day he shall be clean  but if he purify not himself the third day  then the seventh day he shall not be clean   
   whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead  and purifieth not himself  defileth the tabernacle of the lord  and that soul shall be cut off from israel  because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him  he shall be unclean  his uncleanness  is  yet upon him   
   this  is  the law  when a man dieth in a tent  all that come into the tent  and all that  is  in the tent  shall be unclean seven days   
   and every open vessel  which hath no covering bound upon it   is  unclean   
   and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields  or a dead body  or a bone of a man  or a grave  shall be unclean seven days   
   and for an unclean  person  they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin  and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel   
   and a clean person shall take hyssop  and dip  it  in the water  and sprinkle  it  upon the tent  and upon all the vessels  and upon the persons that were there  and upon him that touched a bone  or one slain  or one dead  or a grave   
   and the clean  person  shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day  and on the seventh day  and on the seventh day he shall purify himself  and wash his clothes  and bathe himself in water  and shall be clean at even   
   but the man that shall be unclean  and shall not purify himself  that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation  because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the lord  the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him  he  is  unclean   
   and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them  that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes  and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even   
   and whatsoever the unclean  person  toucheth shall be unclean  and the soul that toucheth  it  shall be unclean until even   
numbers    
   then came the children of israel   even  the whole congregation  into the desert of zin in the first month  and the people abode in kadesh  and miriam died there  and was buried there   
  and there was no water for the congregation  and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron   
  and the people chode with moses  and spake  saying  would god that we had died when our brethren died before the lord   
  and why have ye brought up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness  that we and our cattle should die there   
  and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of egypt  to bring us in unto this evil place  it  is  no place of seed  or of figs  or of vines  or of pomegranates  neither  is  there any water to drink   
  and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  and they fell upon their faces  and the glory of the lord appeared unto them   
  and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  take the rod  and gather thou the assembly together  thou  and aaron thy brother  and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes  and it shall give forth his water  and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock  so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink   
  and moses took the rod from before the lord  as he commanded him   
   and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock  and he said unto them  hear now  ye rebels  must we fetch you water out of this rock   
   and moses lifted up his hand  and with his rod he smote the rock twice  and the water came out abundantly  and the congregation drank  and their beasts  also    
   and the lord spake unto moses and aaron  because ye believed me not  to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel  therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have given them   
   this  is  the water of meribah  because the children of israel strove with the lord  and he was sanctified in them   
    and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom  thus saith thy brother israel  thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us   
   how our fathers went down into egypt  and we have dwelt in egypt a long time  and the egyptians vexed us  and our fathers   
   and when we cried unto the lord  he heard our voice  and sent an angel  and hath brought us forth out of egypt  and  behold  we  are  in kadesh  a city in the uttermost of thy border   
   let us pass  i pray thee  through thy country  we will not pass through the fields  or through the vineyards  neither will we drink  of  the water of the wells  we will go by the king s  high  way  we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left  until we have passed thy borders   
   and edom said unto him  thou shalt not pass by me  lest i come out against thee with the sword   
   and the children of israel said unto him  we will go by the high way  and if i and my cattle drink of thy water  then i will pay for it  i will only  without  doing  any thing  else   go through on my feet   
   and he said  thou shalt not go through  and edom came out against him with much people  and with a strong hand   
   thus edom refused to give israel passage through his border  wherefore israel turned away from him   
    and the children of israel   even  the whole congregation  journeyed from kadesh  and came unto mount hor   
   and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor  by the coast of the land of edom  saying   
   aaron shall be gathered unto his people  for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel  because ye rebelled against my word at the water of meribah   
   take aaron and eleazar his son  and bring them up unto mount hor   
   and strip aaron of his garments  and put them upon eleazar his son  and aaron shall be gathered  unto his people   and shall die there   
   and moses did as the lord commanded  and they went up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation   
   and moses stripped aaron of his garments  and put them upon eleazar his son  and aaron died there in the top of the mount  and moses and eleazar came down from the mount   
   and when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead  they mourned for aaron thirty days   even  all the house of israel   
numbers    
   and  when  king arad the canaanite  which dwelt in the south  heard tell that israel came by the way of the spies  then he fought against israel  and took  some  of them prisoners   
  and israel vowed a vow unto the lord  and said  if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand  then i will utterly destroy their cities   
  and the lord hearkened to the voice of israel  and delivered up the canaanites  and they utterly destroyed them and their cities  and he called the name of the place hormah   
   and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea  to compass the land of edom  and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way   
  and the people spake against god  and against moses  wherefore have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness  for  there is  no bread  neither  is there any  water  and our soul loatheth this light bread   
  and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people  and they bit the people  and much people of israel died   
  therefore the people came to moses  and said  we have sinned  for we have spoken against the lord  and against thee  pray unto the lord  that he take away the serpents from us  and moses prayed for the people   
  and the lord said unto moses  make thee a fiery serpent  and set it upon a pole  and it shall come to pass  that every one that is bitten  when he looketh upon it  shall live   
  and moses made a serpent of brass  and put it upon a pole  and it came to pass  that if a serpent had bitten any man  when he beheld the serpent of brass  he lived   
    and the children of israel set forward  and pitched in oboth   
   and they journeyed from oboth  and pitched at ijeabarim  in the wilderness which  is  before moab  toward the sunrising   
   from thence they removed  and pitched in the valley of zared   
   from thence they removed  and pitched on the other side of arnon  which  is  in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the amorites  for arnon  is  the border of moab  between moab and the amorites   
   wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord  what he did in the red sea  and in the brooks of arnon   
   and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of ar  and lieth upon the border of moab   
   and from thence  they went  to beer  that  is  the well whereof the lord spake unto moses  gather the people together  and i will give them water   
   then israel sang this song  spring up  o well  sing ye unto it   
   the princes digged the well  the nobles of the people digged it  by  the direction of  the lawgiver  with their staves  and from the wilderness  they went  to mattanah   
   and from mattanah to nahaliel  and from nahaliel to bamoth   
   and from bamoth  in  the valley  that  is  in the country of moab  to the top of pisgah  which looketh toward jeshimon   
    and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites  saying   
   let me pass through thy land  we will not turn into the fields  or into the vineyards  we will not drink  of  the waters of the well   but  we will go along by the king s  high  way  until we be past thy borders   
   and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border  but sihon gathered all his people together  and went out against israel into the wilderness  and he came to jahaz  and fought against israel   
   and israel smote him with the edge of the sword  and possessed his land from arnon unto jabbok  even unto the children of ammon  for the border of the children of ammon  was  strong   
   and israel took all these cities  and israel dwelt in all the cities of the amorites  in heshbon  and in all the villages thereof   
   for heshbon  was  the city of sihon the king of the amorites  who had fought against the former king of moab  and taken all his land out of his hand  even unto arnon   
   wherefore they that speak in proverbs say  come into heshbon  let the city of sihon be built and prepared   
   for there is a fire gone out of heshbon  a flame from the city of sihon  it hath consumed ar of moab   and  the lords of the high places of arnon   
   woe to thee  moab  thou art undone  o people of chemosh  he hath given his sons that escaped  and his daughters  into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites   
   we have shot at them  heshbon is perished even unto dibon  and we have laid them waste even unto nophah  which  reacheth  unto medeba   
   thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites   
   and moses sent to spy out jaazer  and they took the villages thereof  and drove out the amorites that  were  there   
   and they turned and went up by the way of bashan  and og the king of bashan went out against them  he  and all his people  to the battle at edrei   
   and the lord said unto moses  fear him not  for i have delivered him into thy hand  and all his people  and his land  and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites  which dwelt at heshbon   
   so they smote him  and his sons  and all his people  until there was none left him alive  and they possessed his land   
numbers    
   and the children of israel set forward  and pitched in the plains of moab on this side jordan  by  jericho   
  and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorites   
  and moab was sore afraid of the people  because they  were  many  and moab was distressed because of the children of israel   
  and moab said unto the elders of midian  now shall this company lick up all  that are  round about us  as the ox licketh up the grass of the field  and balak the son of zippor  was  king of the moabites at that time   
  he sent messengers therefore unto balaam the son of beor to pethor  which  is  by the river of the land of the children of his people  to call him  saying  behold  there is a people come out from egypt  behold  they cover the face of the earth  and they abide over against me   
  come now therefore  i pray thee  curse me this people  for they  are  too mighty for me  peradventure i shall prevail   that  we may smite them  and  that  i may drive them out of the land  for i wot that he whom thou blessest  is  blessed  and he whom thou cursest is cursed   
  and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand  and they came unto balaam  and spake unto him the words of balak   
  and he said unto them  lodge here this night  and i will bring you word again  as the lord shall speak unto me  and the princes of moab abode with balaam   
  and god came unto balaam  and said  what men  are  these with thee   
   and balaam said unto god  balak the son of zippor  king of moab  hath sent unto me   saying    
   behold   there is  a people come out of egypt  which covereth the face of the earth  come now  curse me them  peradventure i shall be able to overcome them  and drive them out   
   and god said unto balaam  thou shalt not go with them  thou shalt not curse the people  for they  are  blessed   
   and balaam rose up in the morning  and said unto the princes of balak  get you into your land  for the lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you   
   and the princes of moab rose up  and they went unto balak  and said  balaam refuseth to come with us   
    and balak sent yet again princes  more  and more honourable than they   
   and they came to balaam  and said to him  thus saith balak the son of zippor  let nothing  i pray thee  hinder thee from coming unto me   
   for i will promote thee unto very great honour  and i will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me  come therefore  i pray thee  curse me this people   
   and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak  if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold  i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god  to do less or more   
   now therefore  i pray you  tarry ye also here this night  that i may know what the lord will say unto me more   
   and god came unto balaam at night  and said unto him  if the men come to call thee  rise up   and  go with them  but yet the word which i shall say unto thee  that shalt thou do   
   and balaam rose up in the morning  and saddled his ass  and went with the princes of moab   
    and god s anger was kindled because he went  and the angel of the lord stood in the way for an adversary against him  now he was riding upon his ass  and his two servants  were  with him   
   and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way  and his sword drawn in his hand  and the ass turned aside out of the way  and went into the field  and balaam smote the ass  to turn her into the way   
   but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyards  a wall  being  on this side  and a wall on that side   
   and when the ass saw the angel of the lord  she thrust herself unto the wall  and crushed balaam s foot against the wall  and he smote her again   
   and the angel of the lord went further  and stood in a narrow place  where  was  no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left   
   and when the ass saw the angel of the lord  she fell down under balaam  and balaam s anger was kindled  and he smote the ass with a staff   
   and the lord opened the mouth of the ass  and she said unto balaam  what have i done unto thee  that thou hast smitten me these three times   
   and balaam said unto the ass  because thou hast mocked me  i would there were a sword in mine hand  for now would i kill thee   
   and the ass said unto balaam   am  not i thine ass  upon which thou hast ridden ever since  i was  thine unto this day  was i ever wont to do so unto thee  and he said  nay   
   then the lord opened the eyes of balaam  and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way  and his sword drawn in his hand  and he bowed down his head  and fell flat on his face   
   and the angel of the lord said unto him  wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times  behold  i went out to withstand thee  because  thy  way is perverse before me   
   and the ass saw me  and turned from me these three times  unless she had turned from me  surely now also i had slain thee  and saved her alive   
   and balaam said unto the angel of the lord  i have sinned  for i knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me  now therefore  if it displease thee  i will get me back again   
   and the angel of the lord said unto balaam  go with the men  but only the word that i shall speak unto thee  that thou shalt speak  so balaam went with the princes of balak   
    and when balak heard that balaam was come  he went out to meet him unto a city of moab  which  is  in the border of arnon  which  is  in the utmost coast   
   and balak said unto balaam  did i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee  wherefore camest thou not unto me  am i not able indeed to promote thee to honour   
   and balaam said unto balak  lo  i am come unto thee  have i now any power at all to say any thing  the word that god putteth in my mouth  that shall i speak   
   and balaam went with balak  and they came unto kirjathhuzoth   
   and balak offered oxen and sheep  and sent to balaam  and to the princes that  were  with him   
   and it came to pass on the morrow  that balak took balaam  and brought him up into the high places of baal  that thence he might see the utmost  part  of the people   
numbers    
   and balaam said unto balak  build me here seven altars  and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams   
  and balak did as balaam had spoken  and balak and balaam offered on  every  altar a bullock and a ram   
  and balaam said unto balak  stand by thy burnt offering  and i will go  peradventure the lord will come to meet me  and whatsoever he sheweth me i will tell thee  and he went to an high place   
  and god met balaam  and he said unto him  i have prepared seven altars  and i have offered upon  every  altar a bullock and a ram   
  and the lord put a word in balaam s mouth  and said  return unto balak  and thus thou shalt speak   
  and he returned unto him  and  lo  he stood by his burnt sacrifice  he  and all the princes of moab   
  and he took up his parable  and said  balak the king of moab hath brought me from aram  out of the mountains of the east   saying   come  curse me jacob  and come  defy israel   
  how shall i curse  whom god hath not cursed  or how shall i defy   whom  the lord hath not defied   
  for from the top of the rocks i see him  and from the hills i behold him  lo  the people shall dwell alone  and shall not be reckoned among the nations   
   who can count the dust of jacob  and the number of the fourth  part  of israel  let me die the death of the righteous  and let my last end be like his   
   and balak said unto balaam  what hast thou done unto me  i took thee to curse mine enemies  and  behold  thou hast blessed  them  altogether   
   and he answered and said  must i not take heed to speak that which the lord hath put in my mouth   
    and balak said unto him  come  i pray thee  with me unto another place  from whence thou mayest see them  thou shalt see but the utmost part of them  and shalt not see them all  and curse me them from thence   
   and he brought him into the field of zophim  to the top of pisgah  and built seven altars  and offered a bullock and a ram on  every  altar   
   and he said unto balak  stand here by thy burnt offering  while i meet  the lord  yonder   
   and the lord met balaam  and put a word in his mouth  and said  go again unto balak  and say thus   
   and when he came to him  behold  he stood by his burnt offering  and the princes of moab with him  and balak said unto him  what hath the lord spoken   
   and he took up his parable  and said  rise up  balak  and hear  hearken unto me  thou son of zippor   
   god  is  not a man  that he should lie  neither the son of man  that he should repent  hath he said  and shall he not do  it   or hath he spoken  and shall he not make it good   
   behold  i have received  commandment  to bless  and he hath blessed  and i cannot reverse it   
   he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob  neither hath he seen perverseness in israel  the lord his god  is  with him  and the shout of a king  is  among them   
   god brought them out of egypt  he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn   
   surely  there is  no enchantment against jacob  neither  is there  any divination against israel  according to this time it shall be said of jacob and of israel  what hath god wrought   
   behold  the people shall rise up as a great lion  and lift up himself as a young lion  he shall not lie down until he eat  of  the prey  and drink the blood of the slain   
   and balak said unto balaam  neither curse them at all  nor bless them at all   
   but balaam answered and said unto balak  told not i thee  saying  all that the lord speaketh  that i must do   
   and balak said unto balaam  come  i pray thee  i will bring thee unto another place  peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from thence   
   and balak brought balaam unto the top of peor  that looketh toward jeshimon   
   and balaam said unto balak  build me here seven altars  and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams   
   and balak did as balaam had said  and offered a bullock and a ram on  every  altar   
numbers    
   and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel  he went not  as at other times  to seek for enchantments  but he set his face toward the wilderness   
  and balaam lifted up his eyes  and he saw israel abiding  in his tents  according to their tribes  and the spirit of god came upon him   
  and he took up his parable  and said  balaam the son of beor hath said  and the man whose eyes are open hath said   
  he hath said  which heard the words of god  which saw the vision of the almighty  falling  into a trance   but having his eyes open   
  how goodly are thy tents  o jacob   and  thy tabernacles  o israel   
  as the valleys are they spread forth  as gardens by the river s side  as the trees of lign aloes which the lord hath planted   and  as cedar trees beside the waters   
  he shall pour the water out of his buckets  and his seed  shall be  in many waters  and his king shall be higher than agag  and his kingdom shall be exalted   
  god brought him forth out of egypt  he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn  he shall eat up the nations his enemies  and shall break their bones  and pierce  them  through with his arrows   
  he couched  he lay down as a lion  and as a great lion  who shall stir him up  blessed  is  he that blesseth thee  and cursed  is  he that curseth thee   
    and balak s anger was kindled against balaam  and he smote his hands together  and balak said unto balaam  i called thee to curse mine enemies  and  behold  thou hast altogether blessed  them  these three times   
   therefore now flee thou to thy place  i thought to promote thee unto great honour  but  lo  the lord hath kept thee back from honour   
   and balaam said unto balak  spake i not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me  saying   
   if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold  i cannot go beyond the commandment of the lord  to do  either  good or bad of mine own mind   but  what the lord saith  that will i speak   
   and now  behold  i go unto my people  come  therefore  and  i will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days   
    and he took up his parable  and said  balaam the son of beor hath said  and the man whose eyes are open hath said   
   he hath said  which heard the words of god  and knew the knowledge of the most high   which  saw the vision of the almighty  falling  into a trance   but having his eyes open   
   i shall see him  but not now  i shall behold him  but not nigh  there shall come a star out of jacob  and a sceptre shall rise out of israel  and shall smite the corners of moab  and destroy all the children of sheth   
   and edom shall be a possession  seir also shall be a possession for his enemies  and israel shall do valiantly   
   out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion  and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city   
   and when he looked on amalek  he took up his parable  and said  amalek  was  the first of the nations  but his latter end  shall be  that he perish for ever   
   and he looked on the kenites  and took up his parable  and said  strong is thy dwellingplace  and thou puttest thy nest in a rock   
   nevertheless the kenite shall be wasted  until asshur shall carry thee away captive   
   and he took up his parable  and said  alas  who shall live when god doeth this   
   and ships  shall come  from the coast of chittim  and shall afflict asshur  and shall afflict eber  and he also shall perish for ever   
   and balaam rose up  and went and returned to his place  and balak also went his way   
numbers    
   and israel abode in shittim  and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of moab   
  and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods  and the people did eat  and bowed down to their gods   
  and israel joined himself unto baalpeor  and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel   
  and the lord said unto moses  take all the heads of the people  and hang them up before the lord against the sun  that the fierce anger of the lord may be turned away from israel   
  and moses said unto the judges of israel  slay ye every one his men that were joined unto baalpeor   
   and  behold  one of the children of israel came and brought unto his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses  and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of israel  who  were  weeping  before  the door of the tabernacle of the congregation   
  and when phinehas  the son of eleazar  the son of aaron the priest  saw  it   he rose up from among the congregation  and took a javelin in his hand   
  and he went after the man of israel into the tent  and thrust both of them through  the man of israel  and the woman through her belly  so the plague was stayed from the children of israel   
  and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   phinehas  the son of eleazar  the son of aaron the priest  hath turned my wrath away from the children of israel  while he was zealous for my sake among them  that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy   
   wherefore say  behold  i give unto him my covenant of peace   
   and he shall have it  and his seed after him   even  the covenant of an everlasting priesthood  because he was zealous for his god  and made an atonement for the children of israel   
   now the name of the israelite that was slain   even  that was slain with the midianitish woman   was  zimri  the son of salu  a prince of a chief house among the simeonites   
   and the name of the midianitish woman that was slain  was  cozbi  the daughter of zur  he  was  head over a people   and  of a chief house in midian   
    and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   vex the midianites  and smite them   
   for they vex you with their wiles  wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of peor  and in the matter of cozbi  the daughter of a prince of midian  their sister  which was slain in the day of the plague for peor s sake   
numbers

  our father died in the wilderness  and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the lord in the company of korah  but died in his own sin  and had no sons   
  why should the name of our father be done away from among his family  because he hath no son  give unto us  therefore  a possession among the brethren of our father

  and if he have no daughter  then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren   
   and if he have no brethren  then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father s brethren

   and when thou hast seen it  thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people  as aaron thy brother was gathered   
   for ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of zin  in the strife of the congregation  to sanctify me at the water before their eyes  that  is  the water of meribah in kadesh in the wilderness of zin   
    and moses spake unto the lord  saying   
   let the lord  the god of the spirits of all flesh  set a man over the congregation   
   which may go out before them  and which may go in before them  and which may lead them out  and which may bring them in  that the congregation of the lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd

   and thou shalt put  some  of thine honour upon him  that all the congregation of the children of israel may be obedient   
   and he shall stand before eleazar the priest  who shall ask  counsel  for him after the judgment of urim before the lord  at his word shall they go out  and at his word they shall come in   both  he  and all the children of israel with him  even all the congregation   
   and moses did as the lord commanded him  and he took joshua  and set him before eleazar the priest  and before all the congregation   
   and he laid his hands upon him  and gave him a charge  as the lord commanded by the hand of moses   
numbers    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying

  if a man vow a vow unto the lord  or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond  he shall not break his word  he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth   
   if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord  and bind herself by a bond   being  in her father s house in her youth   
  and her father hear her vow  and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul  and her father shall hold his peace at her  then all her vows shall stand  and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand   
  but if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth  not any of her vows  or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul  shall stand  and the lord shall forgive her  because her father disallowed her   
  and if she had at all an husband  when she vowed  or uttered ought out of her lips  wherewith she bound her soul   
  and her husband heard  it   and held his peace at her in the day that he heard  it   then her vows shall stand  and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand   
  but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard  it   then he shall make her vow which she vowed  and that which she uttered with her lips  wherewith she bound her soul  of none effect  and the lord shall forgive her   
  but every vow of a widow  and of her that is divorced  wherewith they have bound their souls  shall stand against her   
   and if she vowed in her husband s house  or bound her soul by a bond with an oath   
   and her husband heard  it   and held his peace at her   and  disallowed her not  then all her vows shall stand  and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand   
   but if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard  them  then  whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows  or concerning the bond of her soul  shall not stand  her husband hath made them void  and the lord shall forgive her   
   every vow  and every binding oath to afflict the soul  her husband may establish it  or her husband may make it void   
   but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day  then he establisheth all her vows  or all her bonds  which  are  upon her  he confirmeth them  because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard  them    
   but if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard  them   then he shall bear her iniquity   
   these  are  the statutes  which the lord commanded moses  between a man and his wife  between the father and his daughter   being yet  in her youth in her father s house   
numbers    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  avenge the children of israel of the midianites  afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people   
  and moses spake unto the people  saying  arm some of yourselves unto the war  and let them go against the midianites  and avenge the lord of midian   
  of every tribe a thousand  throughout all the tribes of israel  shall ye send to the war   
  so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel  a thousand of  every  tribe  twelve thousand armed for war   
  and moses sent them to the war  a thousand of  every  tribe  them and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest  to the war  with the holy instruments  and the trumpets to blow in his hand   
   and they warred against the midianites  as the lord commanded moses  and they slew all the males   
  and they slew the kings of midian  beside the rest of them that were slain   namely   evi  and rekem  and zur  and hur  and reba  five kings of midian  balaam also the son of beor they slew with the sword   
  and the children of israel took  all  the women of midian captives  and their little ones  and took the spoil of all their cattle  and all their flocks  and all their goods   
   and they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt  and all their goodly castles  with fire   
   and they took all the spoil  and all the prey   both  of men and of beasts   
   and they brought the captives  and the prey  and the spoil  unto moses  and eleazar the priest  and unto the congregation of the children of israel  unto the camp at the plains of moab  which  are  by jordan  near  jericho   
    and moses  and eleazar the priest  and all the princes of the congregation  went forth to meet them without the camp   
   and moses was wroth with the officers of the host   with  the captains over thousands  and captains over hundreds  which came from the battle   
   and moses said unto them  have ye saved all the women alive   
   behold  these caused the children of israel  through the counsel of balaam  to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor  and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord   
   now therefore kill every male among the little ones  and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him   
   but all the women children  that have not known a man by lying with him  keep alive for yourselves   
   and do ye abide without the camp seven days  whosoever hath killed any person  and whosoever hath touched any slain  purify  both  yourselves and your captives on the third day  and on the seventh day   
   and purify all  your  raiment  and all that is made of skins  and all work of goats   hair   and all things made of wood   
   and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle  this  is  the ordinance of the law which the lord commanded moses   
   only the gold  and the silver  the brass  the iron  the tin  and the lead   
   every thing that may abide the fire  ye shall make  it  go through the fire  and it shall be clean  nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation  and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water   
   and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day  and ye shall be clean  and afterward ye shall come into the camp   
    and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   take the sum of the prey that was taken   both  of man and of beast  thou  and eleazar the priest  and the chief fathers of the congregation   
   and divide the prey into two parts  between them that took the war upon them  who went out to battle  and between all the congregation   
   and levy a tribute unto the lord of the men of war which went out to battle  one soul of five hundred   both  of the persons  and of the beeves  and of the asses  and of the sheep   
   take  it  of their half  and give it unto eleazar the priest   for  an heave offering of the lord   
   and of the children of israel s half  thou shalt take one portion of fifty  of the persons  of the beeves  of the asses  and of the flocks  of all manner of beasts  and give them unto the levites  which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord   
   and moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded moses   
   and the booty   being  the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught  was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep   
   and threescore and twelve thousand beeves   
   and threescore and one thousand asses   
   and thirty and two thousand persons in all  of women that had not known man by lying with him   
   and the half   which was  the portion of them that went out to war  was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep   
   and the lord s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen   
   and the beeves  were  thirty and six thousand  of which the lord s tribute  was  threescore and twelve   
   and the asses  were  thirty thousand and five hundred  of which the lord s tribute  was  threescore and one   
   and the persons  were  sixteen thousand  of which the lord s tribute  was  thirty and two persons   
   and moses gave the tribute   which was  the lord s heave offering  unto eleazar the priest  as the lord commanded moses   
   and of the children of israel s half  which moses divided from the men that warred   
    now the half  that pertained unto  the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand  and  seven thousand and five hundred sheep   
   and thirty and six thousand beeves   
   and thirty thousand asses and five hundred   
   and sixteen thousand persons    
   even of the children of israel s half  moses took one portion of fifty   both  of man and of beast  and gave them unto the levites  which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the lord  as the lord commanded moses   
    and the officers which  were  over thousands of the host  the captains of thousands  and captains of hundreds  came near unto moses   
   and they said unto moses  thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which  are  under our charge  and there lacketh not one man of us   
   we have therefore brought an oblation for the lord  what every man hath gotten  of jewels of gold  chains  and bracelets  rings  earrings  and tablets  to make an atonement for our souls before the lord   
   and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them   even  all wrought jewels   
   and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the lord  of the captains of thousands  and of the captains of hundreds  was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels   
     for  the men of war had taken spoil  every man for himself    
   and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds  and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation   for  a memorial for the children of israel before the lord   
numbers    
   now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very great multitude of cattle  and when they saw the land of jazer  and the land of gilead  that  behold  the place  was  a place for cattle   
  the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spake unto moses  and to eleazar the priest  and unto the princes of the congregation  saying   
  ataroth  and dibon  and jazer  and nimrah  and heshbon  and elealeh  and shebam  and nebo  and beon   
   even  the country which the lord smote before the congregation of israel   is  a land for cattle  and thy servants have cattle   
  wherefore  said they  if we have found grace in thy sight  let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession   and  bring us not over jordan   
  and moses said unto the children of gad and to the children of reuben  shall your brethren go to war  and shall ye sit here   
  and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of israel from going over into the land which the lord hath given them   
  thus did your fathers  when i sent them from kadeshbarnea to see the land   
  for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol  and saw the land  they discouraged the heart of the children of israel  that they should not go into the land which the lord had given them   
   and the lord s anger was kindled the same time  and he sware  saying   
   surely none of the men that came up out of egypt  from twenty years old and upward  shall see the land which i sware unto abraham  unto isaac  and unto jacob  because they have not wholly followed me   
   save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite  and joshua the son of nun  for they have wholly followed the lord   
   and the lord s anger was kindled against israel  and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years  until all the generation  that had done evil in the sight of the lord  was consumed   
   and  behold  ye are risen up in your fathers  stead  an increase of sinful men  to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel   
   for if ye turn away from after him  he will yet again leave them in the wilderness  and ye shall destroy all this people   
    and they came near unto him  and said  we will build sheepfolds here for our cattle  and cities for our little ones   
   but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of israel  until we have brought them unto their place  and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land   
   we will not return unto our houses  until the children of israel have inherited every man his inheritance   
   for we will not inherit with them on yonder side jordan  or forward  because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side jordan eastward   
   and moses said unto them  if ye will do this thing  if ye will go armed before the lord to war   
   and will go all of you armed over jordan before the lord  until he hath driven out his enemies from before him   
   and the land be subdued before the lord  then afterward ye shall return  and be guiltless before the lord  and before israel  and this land shall be your possession before the lord   
   but if ye will not do so  behold  ye have sinned against the lord  and be sure your sin will find you out   
   build you cities for your little ones  and folds for your sheep  and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth   
   and the children of gad and the children of reuben spake unto moses  saying  thy servants will do as my lord commandeth   
   our little ones  our wives  our flocks  and all our cattle  shall be there in the cities of gilead   
   but thy servants will pass over  every man armed for war  before the lord to battle  as my lord saith   
    so concerning them moses commanded eleazar the priest  and joshua the son of nun  and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of israel   
   and moses said unto them  if the children of gad and the children of reuben will pass with you over jordan  every man armed to battle  before the lord  and the land shall be subdued before you  then ye shall give them the land of gilead for a possession   
   but if they will not pass over with you armed  they shall have possessions among you in the land of canaan   
   and the children of gad and the children of reuben answered  saying  as the lord hath said unto thy servants  so will we do   
   we will pass over armed before the lord into the land of canaan  that the possession of our inheritance on this side jordan  may be  ours   
   and moses gave unto them   even  to the children of gad  and to the children of reuben  and unto half the tribe of manasseh the son of joseph  the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites  and the kingdom of og king of bashan  the land  with the cities thereof in the coasts   even  the cities of the country round about   
   and the children of gad built dibon  and ataroth  and aroer   
   and atroth  shophan  and jaazer  and jogbehah   
   and bethnimrah  and bethharan  fenced cities  and folds for sheep   
   and the children of reuben built heshbon  and elealeh  and kirjathaim   
   and nebo  and baalmeon   their names being changed   and shibmah  and gave other names unto the cities which they builded   
   and the children of machir the son of manasseh went to gilead  and took it  and dispossessed the amorite which  was  in it   
   and moses gave gilead unto machir the son of manasseh  and he dwelt therein   
   and jair the son of manasseh went and took the small towns thereof  and called them havothjair   
   and nobah went and took kenath  and the villages thereof  and called it nobah  after his own name   
numbers    
   these  are  the journeys of the children of israel  which went forth out of the land of egypt with their armies under the hand of moses and aaron   
  and moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the lord  and these  are  their journeys according to their goings out   
  and they departed from rameses in the first month  on the fifteenth day of the first month  on the morrow after the passover the children of israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the egyptians   
  for the egyptians buried all  their  firstborn  which the lord had smitten among them  upon their gods also the lord executed judgments   
  and the children of israel removed from rameses  and pitched in succoth   
  and they departed from succoth  and pitched in etham  which  is  in the edge of the wilderness

   and they departed from ebronah  and encamped at eziongaber   
   and they removed from eziongaber  and pitched in the wilderness of zin  which  is  kadesh   
   and they removed from kadesh  and pitched in mount hor  in the edge of the land of edom   
   and aaron the priest went up into mount hor at the commandment of the lord  and died there  in the fortieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt  in the first  day  of the fifth month   
   and aaron  was  an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount hor   
   and king arad the canaanite  which dwelt in the south in the land of canaan  heard of the coming of the children of israel   
   and they departed from mount hor  and pitched in zalmonah   
   and they departed from zalmonah  and pitched in punon   
   and they departed from punon  and pitched in oboth

   and they departed from the mountains of abarim  and pitched in the plains of moab by jordan  near  jericho   
   and they pitched by jordan  from bethjesimoth  even  unto abelshittim in the plains of moab   
    and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan  near  jericho  saying   
   speak unto the children of israel  and say unto them  when ye are passed over jordan into the land of canaan   
   then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you  and destroy all their pictures  and destroy all their molten images  and quite pluck down all their high places   
   and ye shall dispossess  the inhabitants  of the land  and dwell therein  for i have given you the land to possess it   
   and ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families   and  to the more ye shall give the more inheritance  and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance  every man s  inheritance  shall be in the place where his lot falleth  according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit   
   but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you  then it shall come to pass  that those which ye let remain of them  shall be  pricks in your eyes  and thorns in your sides  and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell   
   moreover it shall come to pass   that  i shall do unto you  as i thought to do unto them   
numbers    
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
  command the children of israel  and say unto them  when ye come into the land of canaan   this  is  the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance   even  the land of canaan with the coasts thereof    
  then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of zin along by the coast of edom  and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward   
  and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of akrabbim  and pass on to zin  and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to kadeshbarnea  and shall go on to hazaraddar  and pass on to azmon   
  and the border shall fetch a compass from azmon unto the river of egypt  and the goings out of it shall be at the sea   
  and  as for  the western border  ye shall even have the great sea for a border  this shall be your west border   
  and this shall be your north border  from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount hor   
  from mount hor ye shall point out  your border  unto the entrance of hamath  and the goings forth of the border shall be to zedad   
  and the border shall go on to ziphron  and the goings out of it shall be at hazarenan  this shall be your north border   
   and ye shall point out your east border from hazarenan to shepham   
   and the coast shall go down from shepham to riblah  on the east side of ain  and the border shall descend  and shall reach unto the side of the sea of chinnereth eastward   
   and the border shall go down to jordan  and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea  this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about   
   and moses commanded the children of israel  saying  this  is  the land which ye shall inherit by lot  which the lord commanded to give unto the nine tribes  and to the half tribe   
   for the tribe of the children of reuben according to the house of their fathers  and the tribe of the children of gad according to the house of their fathers  have received  their inheritance   and half the tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance   
   the two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side jordan  near  jericho eastward  toward the sunrising   
    and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   these  are  the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you  eleazar the priest  and joshua the son of nun   
   and ye shall take one prince of every tribe  to divide the land by inheritance   
   and the names of the men  are  these  of the tribe of judah  caleb the son of jephunneh   
   and of the tribe of the children of simeon  shemuel the son of ammihud   
   of the tribe of benjamin  elidad the son of chislon   
   and the prince of the tribe of the children of dan  bukki the son of jogli   
   the prince of the children of joseph  for the tribe of the children of manasseh  hanniel the son of ephod   
   and the prince of the tribe of the children of ephraim  kemuel the son of shiphtan   
   and the prince of the tribe of the children of zebulun  elizaphan the son of parnach   
   and the prince of the tribe of the children of issachar  paltiel the son of azzan   
   and the prince of the tribe of the children of asher  ahihud the son of shelomi   
   and the prince of the tribe of the children of naphtali  pedahel the son of ammihud   
   these  are they  whom the lord commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of israel in the land of canaan   
numbers    
   and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan  near  jericho  saying   
  command the children of israel  that they give unto the levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in  and ye shall give  also  unto the levites suburbs for the cities round about them   
  and the cities shall they have to dwell in  and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle  and for their goods  and for all their beasts   
  and the suburbs of the cities  which ye shall give unto the levites   shall reach  from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about   
  and ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits  and on the south side two thousand cubits  and on the west side two thousand cubits  and on the north side two thousand cubits  and the city  shall be  in the midst  this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities   
  and among the cities which ye shall give unto the levites  there shall be  six cities for refuge  which ye shall appoint for the manslayer  that he may flee thither  and to them ye shall add forty and two cities   
   so  all the cities which ye shall give to the levites  shall be  forty and eight cities  them  shall ye give  with their suburbs   
  and the cities which ye shall give  shall be  of the possession of the children of israel  from  them that have  many ye shall give many  but from  them that have  few ye shall give few  every one shall give of his cities unto the levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth   
   and the lord spake unto moses  saying   
   speak unto the children of israel  and say unto them  when ye be come over jordan into the land of canaan   
   then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you  that the slayer may flee thither  which killeth any person at unawares   
   and they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger  that the manslayer die not  until he stand before the congregation in judgment   
   and of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge   
   ye shall give three cities on this side jordan  and three cities shall ye give in the land of canaan   which  shall be cities of refuge   
   these six cities shall be a refuge   both  for the children of israel  and for the stranger  and for the sojourner among them  that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither   
   and if he smite him with an instrument of iron  so that he die  he  is  a murderer  the murderer shall surely be put to death   
   and if he smite him with throwing a stone  wherewith he may die  and he die  he  is  a murderer  the murderer shall surely be put to death   
   or  if  he smite him with an hand weapon of wood  wherewith he may die  and he die  he  is  a murderer  the murderer shall surely be put to death   
   the revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer  when he meeteth him  he shall slay him   
   but if he thrust him of hatred  or hurl at him by laying of wait  that he die   
   or in enmity smite him with his hand  that he die  he that smote  him  shall surely be put to death   for  he  is  a murderer  the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer  when he meeteth him   
   but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity  or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait   
   or with any stone  wherewith a man may die  seeing  him  not  and cast  it  upon him  that he die  and  was  not his enemy  neither sought his harm   
   then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments   
   and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood  and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge  whither he was fled  and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest  which was anointed with the holy oil   
   but if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge  whither he was fled   
   and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge  and the revenger of blood kill the slayer  he shall not be guilty of blood   
   because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest  but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession   
   so these  things  shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings   
   whoso killeth any person  the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses  but one witness shall not testify against any person  to cause him  to die   
   moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer  which  is  guilty of death  but he shall be surely put to death   
   and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge  that he should come again to dwell in the land  until the death of the priest   
   so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye  are   for blood it defileth the land  and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein  but by the blood of him that shed it   
   defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit  wherein i dwell  for i the lord dwell among the children of israel   
numbers    
   and the chief fathers of the families of the children of gilead  the son of machir  the son of manasseh  of the families of the sons of joseph  came near  and spake before moses  and before the princes  the chief fathers of the children of israel   
  and they said  the lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of israel  and my lord was commanded by the lord to give the inheritance of zelophehad our brother unto his daughters   
  and if they be married to any of the sons of the  other  tribes of the children of israel  then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers  and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received  so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance   
  and when the jubile of the children of israel shall be  then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received  so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers   
   and moses commanded the children of israel according to the word of the lord  saying  the tribe of the sons of joseph hath said well   
  this  is  the thing which the lord doth command concerning the daughters of zelophehad  saying  let them marry to whom they think best  only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry   
  so shall not the inheritance of the children of israel remove from tribe to tribe  for every one of the children of israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers   
  and every daughter  that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of israel  shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father  that the children of israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers   
  neither shall the inheritance remove from  one  tribe to another tribe  but every one of the tribes of the children of israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance   
   even as the lord commanded moses  so did the daughters of zelophehad   
   for mahlah  tirzah  and hoglah  and milcah  and noah  the daughters of zelophehad  were married unto their father s brothers  sons   
    and  they were married into the families of the sons of manasseh the son of joseph  and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father   
   these  are  the commandments and the judgments  which the lord commanded by the hand of moses unto the children of israel in the plains of moab by jordan  near  jericho   
 
deuteronomy 
deuteronmy   
   these  be  the words which moses spake unto all israel on this side jordan in the wilderness  in the plain over against the red  sea   between paran  and tophel  and laban  and hazeroth  and dizahab   
    there are  eleven days   journey  from horeb by the way of mount seir unto kadeshbarnea    
  and it came to pass in the fortieth year  in the eleventh month  on the first  day  of the month   that  moses spake unto the children of israel  according unto all that the lord had given him in commandment unto them   
  after he had slain sihon the king of the amorites  which dwelt in heshbon  and og the king of bashan  which dwelt at astaroth in edrei   
  on this side jordan  in the land of moab  began moses to declare this law  saying   
  the lord our god spake unto us in horeb  saying  ye have dwelt long enough in this mount   
  turn you  and take your journey  and go to the mount of the amorites  and unto all  the places  nigh thereunto  in the plain  in the hills  and in the vale  and in the south  and by the sea side  to the land of the canaanites  and unto lebanon  unto the great river  the river euphrates   
  behold  i have set the land before you  go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers  abraham  isaac  and jacob  to give unto them and to their seed after them   
   and i spake unto you at that time  saying  i am not able to bear you myself alone   
   the lord your god hath multiplied you  and  behold  ye  are  this day as the stars of heaven for multitude   
    the lord god of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye  are   and bless you  as he hath promised you    
   how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance  and your burden  and your strife   
   take you wise men  and understanding  and known among your tribes  and i will make them rulers over you   
   and ye answered me  and said  the thing which thou hast spoken  is  good  for us  to do   
   so i took the chief of your tribes  wise men  and known  and made them heads over you  captains over thousands  and captains over hundreds  and captains over fifties  and captains over tens  and officers among your tribes   
   and i charged your judges at that time  saying  hear  the causes  between your brethren  and judge righteously between  every  man and his brother  and the stranger  that is  with him   
   ye shall not respect persons in judgment   but  ye shall hear the small as well as the great  ye shall not be afraid of the face of man  for the judgment  is  god s  and the cause that is too hard for you  bring  it  unto me  and i will hear it   
   and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do   
    and when we departed from horeb  we went through all that great and terrible wilderness  which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the amorites  as the lord our god commanded us  and we came to kadeshbarnea   
   and i said unto you  ye are come unto the mountain of the amorites  which the lord our god doth give unto us   
   behold  the lord thy god hath set the land before thee  go up  and  possess  it   as the lord god of thy fathers hath said unto thee  fear not  neither be discouraged   
   and ye came near unto me every one of you  and said  we will send men before us  and they shall search us out the land  and bring us word again by what way we must go up  and into what cities we shall come   
   and the saying pleased me well  and i took twelve men of you  one of a tribe   
   and they turned and went up into the mountain  and came unto the valley of eshcol  and searched it out   
   and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands  and brought  it  down unto us  and brought us word again  and said   it is  a good land which the lord our god doth give us   
   notwithstanding ye would not go up  but rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god   
   and ye murmured in your tents  and said  because the lord hated us  he hath brought us forth out of the land of egypt  to deliver us into the hand of the amorites  to destroy us   
   whither shall we go up  our brethren have discouraged our heart  saying  the people  is  greater and taller than we  the cities  are  great and walled up to heaven  and moreover we have seen the sons of the anakims there   
   then i said unto you  dread not  neither be afraid of them   
   the lord your god which goeth before you  he shall fight for you  according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes   
   and in the wilderness  where thou hast seen how that the lord thy god bare thee  as a man doth bear his son  in all the way that ye went  until ye came into this place   
   yet in this thing ye did not believe the lord your god   
   who went in the way before you  to search you out a place to pitch your tents  in   in fire by night  to shew you by what way ye should go  and in a cloud by day   
   and the lord heard the voice of your words  and was wroth  and sware  saying   
   surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land  which i sware to give unto your fathers   
   save caleb the son of jephunneh  he shall see it  and to him will i give the land that he hath trodden upon  and to his children  because he hath wholly followed the lord   
   also the lord was angry with me for your sakes  saying  thou also shalt not go in thither   
    but  joshua the son of nun  which standeth before thee  he shall go in thither  encourage him  for he shall cause israel to inherit it   
   moreover your little ones  which ye said should be a prey  and your children  which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil  they shall go in thither  and unto them will i give it  and they shall possess it   
   but  as for  you  turn you  and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea   
   then ye answered and said unto me  we have sinned against the lord  we will go up and fight  according to all that the lord our god commanded us  and when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war  ye were ready to go up into the hill   
   and the lord said unto me  say unto them  go not up  neither fight  for i  am  not among you  lest ye be smitten before your enemies   
   so i spake unto you  and ye would not hear  but rebelled against the commandment of the lord  and went presumptuously up into the hill   
   and the amorites  which dwelt in that mountain  came out against you  and chased you  as bees do  and destroyed you in seir   even  unto hormah   
   and ye returned and wept before the lord  but the lord would not hearken to your voice  nor give ear unto you   
   so ye abode in kadesh many days  according unto the days that ye abode  there    
deuteronmy   
   then we turned  and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea  as the lord spake unto me  and we compassed mount seir many days   
  and the lord spake unto me  saying   
  ye have compassed this mountain long enough  turn you northward   
  and command thou the people  saying  ye  are  to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of esau  which dwell in seir  and they shall be afraid of you  take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore   
  meddle not with them  for i will not give you of their land  no  not so much as a foot breadth  because i have given mount seir unto esau  for  a possession   
  ye shall buy meat of them for money  that ye may eat  and ye shall also buy water of them for money  that ye may drink   
  for the lord thy god hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand  he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness  these forty years the lord thy god  hath been  with thee  thou hast lacked nothing   
   and when we passed by from our brethren the children of esau  which dwelt in seir  through the way of the plain from elath  and from eziongaber  we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of moab   
  and the lord said unto me  distress not the moabites  neither contend with them in battle  for i will not give thee of their land  for  a possession  because i have given ar unto the children of lot  for  a possession   
   the emims dwelt therein in times past  a people great  and many  and tall  as the anakims   
   which also were accounted giants  as the anakims  but the moabites call them emims   
   the horims also dwelt in seir beforetime  but the children of esau succeeded them  when they had destroyed them from before them  and dwelt in their stead  as israel did unto the land of his possession  which the lord gave unto them   
   now rise up   said i   and get you over the brook zered  and we went over the brook zered   
   and the space in which we came from kadeshbarnea  until we were come over the brook zered   was  thirty and eight years  until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host  as the lord sware unto them   
   for indeed the hand of the lord was against them  to destroy them from among the host  until they were consumed   
   so it came to pass  when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people   
   that the lord spake unto me  saying   
   thou art to pass over through ar  the coast of moab  this day   
   and  when  thou comest nigh over against the children of ammon  distress them not  nor meddle with them  for i will not give thee of the land of the children of ammon  any  possession  because i have given it unto the children of lot  for  a possession   
    that also was accounted a land of giants  giants dwelt therein in old time  and the ammonites call them zamzummims   
   a people great  and many  and tall  as the anakims  but the lord destroyed them before them  and they succeeded them  and dwelt in their stead   
   as he did to the children of esau  which dwelt in seir  when he destroyed the horims from before them  and they succeeded them  and dwelt in their stead even unto this day   
   and the avims which dwelt in hazerim   even  unto azzah  the caphtorims  which came forth out of caphtor  destroyed them  and dwelt in their stead    
    rise ye up  take your journey  and pass over the river arnon  behold  i have given into thine hand sihon the amorite  king of heshbon  and his land  begin to possess  it   and contend with him in battle   
   this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations  that are  under the whole heaven  who shall hear report of thee  and shall tremble  and be in anguish because of thee   
   and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with words of peace  saying   
   let me pass through thy land  i will go along by the high way  i will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left   
   thou shalt sell me meat for money  that i may eat  and give me water for money  that i may drink  only i will pass through on my feet   
    as the children of esau which dwell in seir  and the moabites which dwell in ar  did unto me   until i shall pass over jordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us   
   but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him  for the lord thy god hardened his spirit  and made his heart obstinate  that he might deliver him into thy hand  as  appeareth  this day   
   and the lord said unto me  behold  i have begun to give sihon and his land before thee  begin to possess  that thou mayest inherit his land   
   then sihon came out against us  he and all his people  to fight at jahaz   
   and the lord our god delivered him before us  and we smote him  and his sons  and all his people   
   and we took all his cities at that time  and utterly destroyed the men  and the women  and the little ones  of every city  we left none to remain   
   only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves  and the spoil of the cities which we took   
   from aroer  which  is  by the brink of the river of arnon  and  from  the city that  is  by the river  even unto gilead  there was not one city too strong for us  the lord our god delivered all unto us   
   only unto the land of the children of ammon thou camest not   nor  unto any place of the river jabbok  nor unto the cities in the mountains  nor unto whatsoever the lord our god forbad us   
deuteronmy   
   then we turned  and went up the way to bashan  and og the king of bashan came out against us  he and all his people  to battle at edrei   
  and the lord said unto me  fear him not  for i will deliver him  and all his people  and his land  into thy hand  and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites  which dwelt at heshbon   
  so the lord our god delivered into our hands og also  the king of bashan  and all his people  and we smote him until none was left to him remaining   
  and we took all his cities at that time  there was not a city which we took not from them  threescore cities  all the region of argob  the kingdom of og in bashan   
  all these cities  were  fenced with high walls  gates  and bars  beside unwalled towns a great many   
  and we utterly destroyed them  as we did unto sihon king of heshbon  utterly destroying the men  women  and children  of every city   
  but all the cattle  and the spoil of the cities  we took for a prey to ourselves   
  and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the amorites the land that  was  on this side jordan  from the river of arnon unto mount hermon   
    which  hermon the sidonians call sirion  and the amorites call it shenir    
   all the cities of the plain  and all gilead  and all bashan  unto salchah and edrei  cities of the kingdom of og in bashan   
   for only og king of bashan remained of the remnant of giants  behold  his bedstead  was  a bedstead of iron   is  it not in rabbath of the children of ammon  nine cubits  was  the length thereof  and four cubits the breadth of it  after the cubit of a man   
    and this land   which  we possessed at that time  from aroer  which  is  by the river arnon  and half mount gilead  and the cities thereof  gave i unto the reubenites and to the gadites   
   and the rest of gilead  and all bashan   being  the kingdom of og  gave i unto the half tribe of manasseh  all the region of argob  with all bashan  which was called the land of giants   
   jair the son of manasseh took all the country of argob unto the coasts of geshuri and maachathi  and called them after his own name  bashanhavothjair  unto this day   
   and i gave gilead unto machir   
   and unto the reubenites and unto the gadites i gave from gilead even unto the river arnon half the valley  and the border even unto the river jabbok   which is  the border of the children of ammon   
   the plain also  and jordan  and the coast  thereof   from chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain   even  the salt sea  under ashdothpisgah eastward   
   and i commanded you at that time  saying  the lord your god hath given you this land to possess it  ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of israel  all  that are  meet for the war   
   but your wives  and your little ones  and your cattle    for  i know that ye have much cattle   shall abide in your cities which i have given you   
   until the lord have given rest unto your brethren  as well as unto you  and  until  they also possess the land which the lord your god hath given them beyond jordan  and  then  shall ye return every man unto his possession  which i have given you   
    and i commanded joshua at that time  saying  thine eyes have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto these two kings  so shall the lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest   
   ye shall not fear them  for the lord your god he shall fight for you   
   and i besought the lord at that time  saying   
   o lord god  thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness  and thy mighty hand  for what god  is there  in heaven or in earth  that can do according to thy works  and according to thy might   
   i pray thee  let me go over  and see the good land that  is  beyond jordan  that goodly mountain  and lebanon   
   but the lord was wroth with me for your sakes  and would not hear me  and the lord said unto me  let it suffice thee  speak no more unto me of this matter   
   get thee up into the top of pisgah  and lift up thine eyes westward  and northward  and southward  and eastward  and behold  it  with thine eyes  for thou shalt not go over this jordan   
   but charge joshua  and encourage him  and strengthen him  for he shall go over before this people  and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see   
   so we abode in the valley over against bethpeor   
deuteronmy   
   now therefore hearken  o israel  unto the statutes and unto the judgments  which i teach you  for to do  them   that ye may live  and go in and possess the land which the lord god of your fathers giveth you   
  ye shall not add unto the word which i command you  neither shall ye diminish  ought  from it  that ye may keep the commandments of the lord your god which i command you   
  your eyes have seen what the lord did because of baalpeor  for all the men that followed baalpeor  the lord thy god hath destroyed them from among you   
  but ye that did cleave unto the lord your god  are  alive every one of you this day   
  behold  i have taught you statutes and judgments  even as the lord my god commanded me  that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it   
  keep therefore and do  them   for this  is  your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations  which shall hear all these statutes  and say  surely this great nation  is  a wise and understanding people   
  for what nation  is there so  great  who  hath  god  so  nigh unto them  as the lord our god  is  in all  things that  we call upon him  for    
  and what nation  is there so  great  that hath statutes and judgments  so  righteous as all this law  which i set before you this day   
  only take heed to thyself  and keep thy soul diligently  lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen  and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life  but teach them thy sons  and thy sons  sons   
    specially  the day that thou stoodest before the lord thy god in horeb  when the lord said unto me  gather me the people together  and i will make them hear my words  that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth  and  that  they may teach their children   
   and ye came near and stood under the mountain  and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven  with darkness  clouds  and thick darkness   
   and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire  ye heard the voice of the words  but saw no similitude  only  ye heard  a voice   
   and he declared unto you his covenant  which he commanded you to perform   even  ten commandments  and he wrote them upon two tables of stone   
   and the lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments  that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it   
   take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves  for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day  that  the lord spake unto you in horeb out of the midst of the fire   
   lest ye corrupt  yourselves   and make you a graven image  the similitude of any figure  the likeness of male or female   
   the likeness of any beast that  is  on the earth  the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air   
   the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground  the likeness of any fish that  is  in the waters beneath the earth   
   and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven  and when thou seest the sun  and the moon  and the stars   even  all the host of heaven  shouldest be driven to worship them  and serve them  which the lord thy god hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven   
   but the lord hath taken you  and brought you forth out of the iron furnace   even  out of egypt  to be unto him a people of inheritance  as  ye are  this day   
   furthermore the lord was angry with me for your sakes  and sware that i should not go over jordan  and that i should not go in unto that good land  which the lord thy god giveth thee  for  an inheritance   
   but i must die in this land  i must not go over jordan  but ye shall go over  and possess that good land   
   take heed unto yourselves  lest ye forget the covenant of the lord your god  which he made with you  and make you a graven image   or  the likeness of any  thing   which the lord thy god hath forbidden thee   
   for the lord thy god  is  a consuming fire   even  a jealous god   
   when thou shalt beget children  and children s children  and ye shall have remained long in the land  and shall corrupt  yourselves   and make a graven image   or  the likeness of any  thing   and shall do evil in the sight of the lord thy god  to provoke him to anger   
   i call heaven and earth to witness against you this day  that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan to possess it  ye shall not prolong  your  days upon it  but shall utterly be destroyed   
   and the lord shall scatter you among the nations  and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen  whither the lord shall lead you   
   and there ye shall serve gods  the work of men s hands  wood and stone  which neither see  nor hear  nor eat  nor smell   
   but if from thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god  thou shalt find  him   if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul   
   when thou art in tribulation  and all these things are come upon thee   even  in the latter days  if thou turn to the lord thy god  and shalt be obedient unto his voice   
    for the lord thy god  is  a merciful god   he will not forsake thee  neither destroy thee  nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them   
   for ask now of the days that are past  which were before thee  since the day that god created man upon the earth  and  ask  from the one side of heaven unto the other  whether there hath been  any such thing  as this great thing  is   or hath been heard like it   
   did  ever  people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the fire  as thou hast heard  and live   
   or hath god assayed to go  and  take him a nation from the midst of  another  nation  by temptations  by signs  and by wonders  and by war  and by a mighty hand  and by a stretched out arm  and by great terrors  according to all that the lord your god did for you in egypt before your eyes   
   unto thee it was shewed  that thou mightest know that the lord he  is  god   there is  none else beside him   
   out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice  that he might instruct thee  and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire  and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire   
   and because he loved thy fathers  therefore he chose their seed after them  and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of egypt   
   to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou  art   to bring thee in  to give thee their land  for  an inheritance  as  it is  this day   
   know therefore this day  and consider  it  in thine heart  that the lord he  is  god in heaven above  and upon the earth beneath   there is  none else   
   thou shalt keep therefore his statutes  and his commandments  which i command thee this day  that it may go well with thee  and with thy children after thee  and that thou mayest prolong  thy  days upon the earth  which the lord thy god giveth thee  for ever   
    then moses severed three cities on this side jordan toward the sunrising   
   that the slayer might flee thither  which should kill his neighbour unawares  and hated him not in times past  and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live   
    namely   bezer in the wilderness  in the plain country  of the reubenites  and ramoth in gilead  of the gadites  and golan in bashan  of the manassites   
   and this  is  the law which moses set before the children of israel   
   these  are  the testimonies  and the statutes  and the judgments  which moses spake unto the children of israel  after they came forth out of egypt   
   on this side jordan  in the valley over against bethpeor  in the land of sihon king of the amorites  who dwelt at heshbon  whom moses and the children of israel smote  after they were come forth out of egypt   
   and they possessed his land  and the land of og king of bashan  two kings of the amorites  which  were  on this side jordan toward the sunrising   
   from aroer  which  is  by the bank of the river arnon  even unto mount sion  which  is  hermon   
   and all the plain on this side jordan eastward  even unto the sea of the plain  under the springs of pisgah   
deuteronmy   
   and moses called all israel  and said unto them  hear  o israel  the statutes and judgments which i speak in your ears this day  that ye may learn them  and keep  and do them   
  the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb   
  the lord made not this covenant with our fathers  but with us   even  us  who  are  all of us here alive this day   
  the lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire   
   i stood between the lord and you at that time  to shew you the word of the lord  for ye were afraid by reason of the fire  and went not up into the mount   saying   
   i  am  the lord thy god  which brought thee out of the land of egypt  from the house of bondage   
  thou shalt have none other gods before me   
  thou shalt not make thee  any  graven image   or  any likeness  of any thing  that  is  in heaven above  or that  is  in the earth beneath  or that  is  in the waters beneath the earth   
  thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them  nor serve them  for i the lord thy god  am  a jealous god  visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth  generation  of them that hate me   
   and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments   
   thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain  for the lord will not hold  him  guiltless that taketh his name in vain   
   keep the sabbath day to sanctify it  as the lord thy god hath commanded thee   
   six days thou shalt labour  and do all thy work   
   but the seventh day  is  the sabbath of the lord thy god   in it  thou shalt not do any work  thou  nor thy son  nor thy daughter  nor thy manservant  nor thy maidservant  nor thine ox  nor thine ass  nor any of thy cattle  nor thy stranger that  is  within thy gates  that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou   
   and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt  and  that  the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm  therefore the lord thy god commanded thee to keep the sabbath day   
   honour thy father and thy mother  as the lord thy god hath commanded thee  that thy days may be prolonged  and that it may go well with thee  in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee   
   thou shalt not kill   
   neither shalt thou commit adultery   
   neither shalt thou steal   
   neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour   
   neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour s wife  neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour s house  his field  or his manservant  or his maidservant  his ox  or his ass  or any  thing  that  is  thy neighbour s   
   these words the lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire  of the cloud  and of the thick darkness  with a great voice  and he added no more  and he wrote them in two tables of stone  and delivered them unto me   
    and it came to pass  when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness   for the mountain did burn with fire   that ye came near unto me   even  all the heads of your tribes  and your elders   
   and ye said  behold  the lord our god hath shewed us his glory and his greatness  and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire  we have seen this day that god doth talk with man  and he liveth   
   now therefore why should we die  for this great fire will consume us  if we hear the voice of the lord our god any more  then we shall die   
   for who  is there of  all flesh  that hath heard the voice of the living god speaking out of the midst of the fire  as we  have   and lived   
   go thou near  and hear all that the lord our god shall say  and speak thou unto us all that the lord our god shall speak unto thee  and we will hear  it   and do  it    
   and the lord heard the voice of your words  when ye spake unto me  and the lord said unto me  i have heard the voice of the words of this people  which they have spoken unto thee  they have well said all that they have spoken   
   o that there were such an heart in them  that they would fear me  and keep all my commandments always  that it might be well with them  and with their children for ever   
   go say to them  get you into your tents again   
   but as for thee  stand thou here by me  and i will speak unto thee all the commandments  and the statutes  and the judgments  which thou shalt teach them  that they may do  them  in the land which i give them to possess it   
   ye shall observe to do therefore as the lord your god hath commanded you  ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left   
   ye shall walk in all the ways which the lord your god hath commanded you  that ye may live  and  that it may be  well with you  and  that  ye may prolong  your  days in the land which ye shall possess   
deuteronmy   
   now these  are  the commandments  the statutes  and the judgments  which the lord your god commanded to teach you  that ye might do  them  in the land whither ye go to possess it   
  that thou mightest fear the lord thy god  to keep all his statutes and his commandments  which i command thee  thou  and thy son  and thy son s son  all the days of thy life  and that thy days may be prolonged   
  hear therefore  o israel  and observe to do  it   that it may be well with thee  and that ye may increase mightily  as the lord god of thy fathers hath promised thee  in the land that floweth with milk and honey   
   hear  o israel  the lord our god  is  one lord   
  and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart  and with all thy soul  and with all thy might   
  and these words  which i command thee this day  shall be in thine heart   
  and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children  and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house  and when thou walkest by the way  and when thou liest down  and when thou risest up   
  and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand  and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes   
  and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house  and on thy gates   
   and it shall be  when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers  to abraham  to isaac  and to jacob  to give thee great and goodly cities  which thou buildedst not   
   and houses full of all good  things   which thou filledst not  and wells digged  which thou diggedst not  vineyards and olive trees  which thou plantedst not  when thou shalt have eaten and be full   
    then  beware lest thou forget the lord  which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt  from the house of bondage   
   thou shalt fear the lord thy god  and serve him  and shalt swear by his name   
   ye shall not go after other gods  of the gods of the people which  are  round about you   
    for the lord thy god  is  a jealous god among you  lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindled against thee  and destroy thee from off the face of the earth   
   ye shall not tempt the lord your god  as ye tempted  him  in massah   
    ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the lord your god  and his testimonies  and his statutes  which he hath commanded thee   
   and thou shalt do  that which is  right and good in the sight of the lord  that it may be well with thee  and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the lord sware unto thy fathers   
   to cast out all thine enemies from before thee  as the lord hath spoken   
    and  when thy son asketh thee in time to come  saying  what  mean  the testimonies  and the statutes  and the judgments  which the lord our god hath commanded you   
   then thou shalt say unto thy son  we were pharaoh s bondmen in egypt  and the lord brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand   
   and the lord shewed signs and wonders  great and sore  upon egypt  upon pharaoh  and upon all his household  before our eyes   
   and he brought us out from thence  that he might bring us in  to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers   
   and the lord commanded us to do all these statutes  to fear the lord our god  for our good always  that he might preserve us alive  as  it is  at this day   
   and it shall be our righteousness  if we observe to do all these commandments before the lord our god  as he hath commanded us   
deuteronmy   
   when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it  and hath cast out many nations before thee  the hittites  and the girgashites  and the amorites  and the canaanites  and the perizzites  and the hivites  and the jebusites  seven nations greater and mightier than thou   
  and when the lord thy god shall deliver them before thee  thou shalt smite them   and  utterly destroy them  thou shalt make no covenant with them  nor shew mercy unto them   
  neither shalt thou make marriages with them  thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son  nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son   
  for they will turn away thy son from following me  that they may serve other gods  so will the anger of the lord be kindled against you  and destroy thee suddenly   
  but thus shall ye deal with them  ye shall destroy their altars  and break down their images  and cut down their groves  and burn their graven images with fire   
  for thou  art  an holy people unto the lord thy god  the lord thy god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself  above all people that  are  upon the face of the earth   
  the lord did not set his love upon you  nor choose you  because ye were more in number than any people  for ye  were  the fewest of all people   
  but because the lord loved you  and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers  hath the lord brought you out with a mighty hand  and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen  from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt   
  know therefore that the lord thy god  he  is  god  the faithful god  which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations   
   and repayeth them that hate him to their face  to destroy them  he will not be slack to him that hateth him  he will repay him to his face   
   thou shalt therefore keep the commandments  and the statutes  and the judgments  which i command thee this day  to do them   
    wherefore it shall come to pass  if ye hearken to these judgments  and keep  and do them  that the lord thy god shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers   
   and he will love thee  and bless thee  and multiply thee  he will also bless the fruit of thy womb  and the fruit of thy land  thy corn  and thy wine  and thine oil  the increase of thy kine  and the flocks of thy sheep  in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee   
   thou shalt be blessed above all people  there shall not be male or female barren among you  or among your cattle   
   and the lord will take away from thee all sickness  and will put none of the evil diseases of egypt  which thou knowest  upon thee  but will lay them upon all  them  that hate thee   
   and thou shalt consume all the people which the lord thy god shall deliver thee  thine eye shall have no pity upon them  neither shalt thou serve their gods  for that  will be  a snare unto thee   
   if thou shalt say in thine heart  these nations  are  more than i  how can i dispossess them   
   thou shalt not be afraid of them   but  shalt well remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh  and unto all egypt   
   the great temptations which thine eyes saw  and the signs  and the wonders  and the mighty hand  and the stretched out arm  whereby the lord thy god brought thee out  so shall the lord thy god do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid   
   moreover the lord thy god will send the hornet among them  until they that are left  and hide themselves from thee  be destroyed   
   thou shalt not be affrighted at them  for the lord thy god  is  among you  a mighty god and terrible   
   and the lord thy god will put out those nations before thee by little and little  thou mayest not consume them at once  lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee   
   but the lord thy god shall deliver them unto thee  and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction  until they be destroyed   
   and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand  and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven  there shall no man be able to stand before thee  until thou have destroyed them   
   the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire  thou shalt not desire the silver or gold  that is  on them  nor take  it  unto thee  lest thou be snared therein  for it  is  an abomination to the lord thy god   
   neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house  lest thou be a cursed thing like it   but  thou shalt utterly detest it  and thou shalt utterly abhor it  for it  is  a cursed thing   
deuteronmy   
   all the commandments which i command thee this day shall ye observe to do  that ye may live  and multiply  and go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers   
  and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years in the wilderness  to humble thee   and  to prove thee  to know what  was  in thine heart  whether thou wouldest keep his commandments  or no   
  and he humbled thee  and suffered thee to hunger  and fed thee with manna  which thou knewest not  neither did thy fathers know  that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only  but by every  word  that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live   
  thy raiment waxed not old upon thee  neither did thy foot swell  these forty years   
  thou shalt also consider in thine heart  that  as a man chasteneth his son   so  the lord thy god chasteneth thee   
  therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god  to walk in his ways  and to fear him   
  for the lord thy god bringeth thee into a good land  a land of brooks of water  of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills   
  a land of wheat  and barley  and vines  and fig trees  and pomegranates  a land of oil olive  and honey   
  a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness  thou shalt not lack any  thing  in it  a land whose stones  are  iron  and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass   
    when thou hast eaten and art full  then thou shalt bless the lord thy god for the good land which he hath given thee   
   beware that thou forget not the lord thy god  in not keeping his commandments  and his judgments  and his statutes  which i command thee this day   
   lest  when  thou hast eaten and art full  and hast built goodly houses  and dwelt  therein    
   and  when  thy herds and thy flocks multiply  and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied  and all that thou hast is multiplied   
   then thine heart be lifted up  and thou forget the lord thy god  which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt  from the house of bondage   
   who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness   wherein were  fiery serpents  and scorpions  and drought  where  there was  no water  who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint   
   who fed thee in the wilderness with manna  which thy fathers knew not  that he might humble thee  and that he might prove thee  to do thee good at thy latter end   
   and thou say in thine heart  my power and the might of  mine  hand hath gotten me this wealth   
   but thou shalt remember the lord thy god  for  it is  he that giveth thee power to get wealth  that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers  as  it is  this day   
   and it shall be  if thou do at all forget the lord thy god  and walk after other gods  and serve them  and worship them  i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish   
   as the nations which the lord destroyeth before your face  so shall ye perish  because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the lord your god   
deuteronmy   
   hear  o israel  thou  art  to pass over jordan this day  to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself  cities great and fenced up to heaven   
  a people great and tall  the children of the anakims  whom thou knowest  and  of whom  thou hast heard  say   who can stand before the children of anak   
  understand therefore this day  that the lord thy god  is  he which goeth over before thee   as  a consuming fire he shall destroy them  and he shall bring them down before thy face  so shalt thou drive them out  and destroy them quickly  as the lord hath said unto thee   
  speak not thou in thine heart  after that the lord thy god hath cast them out from before thee  saying  for my righteousness the lord hath brought me in to possess this land  but for the wickedness of these nations the lord doth drive them out from before thee   
  not for thy righteousness  or for the uprightness of thine heart  dost thou go to possess their land  but for the wickedness of these nations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee  and that he may perform the word which the lord sware unto thy fathers  abraham  isaac  and jacob   
  understand therefore  that the lord thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness  for thou  art  a stiffnecked people   
   remember   and  forget not  how thou provokedst the lord thy god to wrath in the wilderness  from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of egypt  until ye came unto this place  ye have been rebellious against the lord   
  also in horeb ye provoked the lord to wrath  so that the lord was angry with you to have destroyed you   
  when i was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone   even  the tables of the covenant which the lord made with you  then i abode in the mount forty days and forty nights  i neither did eat bread nor drink water   
   and the lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of god  and on them  was written  according to all the words  which the lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly   
   and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights   that  the lord gave me the two tables of stone   even  the tables of the covenant   
   and the lord said unto me  arise  get thee down quickly from hence  for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of egypt have corrupted  themselves   they are quickly turned aside out of the way which i commanded them  they have made them a molten image   
   furthermore the lord spake unto me  saying  i have seen this people  and  behold  it  is  a stiffnecked people   
   let me alone  that i may destroy them  and blot out their name from under heaven  and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they   
   so i turned and came down from the mount  and the mount burned with fire  and the two tables of the covenant  were  in my two hands   
   and i looked  and  behold  ye had sinned against the lord your god   and  had made you a molten calf  ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the lord had commanded you   
   and i took the two tables  and cast them out of my two hands  and brake them before your eyes   
   and i fell down before the lord  as at the first  forty days and forty nights  i did neither eat bread  nor drink water  because of all your sins which ye sinned  in doing wickedly in the sight of the lord  to provoke him to anger   
   for i was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure  wherewith the lord was wroth against you to destroy you  but the lord hearkened unto me at that time also   
   and the lord was very angry with aaron to have destroyed him  and i prayed for aaron also the same time   
   and i took your sin  the calf which ye had made  and burnt it with fire  and stamped it   and  ground  it  very small   even  until it was as small as dust  and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount   
   and at taberah  and at massah  and at kibrothhattaavah  ye provoked the lord to wrath   
   likewise when the lord sent you from kadeshbarnea  saying  go up and possess the land which i have given you  then ye rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god  and ye believed him not  nor hearkened to his voice   
   ye have been rebellious against the lord from the day that i knew you   
   thus i fell down before the lord forty days and forty nights  as i fell down  at the first   because the lord had said he would destroy you   
   i prayed therefore unto the lord  and said  o lord god  destroy not thy people and thine inheritance  which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness  which thou hast brought forth out of egypt with a mighty hand   
   remember thy servants  abraham  isaac  and jacob  look not unto the stubbornness of this people  nor to their wickedness  nor to their sin   
   lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say  because the lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them  and because he hated them  he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness   
   yet they  are  thy people and thine inheritance  which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm   
deuteronmy    
   at that time the lord said unto me  hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first  and come up unto me into the mount  and make thee an ark of wood   
  and i will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest  and thou shalt put them in the ark   
  and i made an ark  of  shittim wood  and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first  and went up into the mount  having the two tables in mine hand   
  and he wrote on the tables  according to the first writing  the ten commandments  which the lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly  and the lord gave them unto me   
  and i turned myself and came down from the mount  and put the tables in the ark which i had made  and there they be  as the lord commanded me   
  and the children of israel took their journey from beeroth of the children of jaakan to mosera  there aaron died  and there he was buried  and eleazar his son ministered in the priest s office in his stead   
  from thence they journeyed unto gudgodah  and from gudgodah to jotbath  a land of rivers of waters   
  at that time the lord separated the tribe of levi  to bear the ark of the covenant of the lord  to stand before the lord to minister unto him  and to bless in his name  unto this day   
  wherefore levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren  the lord  is  his inheritance  according as the lord thy god promised him   
   and i stayed in the mount  according to the first time  forty days and forty nights  and the lord hearkened unto me at that time also   and  the lord would not destroy thee   
   and the lord said unto me  arise  take  thy  journey before the people  that they may go in and possess the land  which i sware unto their fathers to give unto them   
    and now  israel  what doth the lord thy god require of thee  but to fear the lord thy god  to walk in all his ways  and to love him  and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul   
   to keep the commandments of the lord  and his statutes  which i command thee this day for thy good   
   behold  the heaven and the heaven of heavens  is  the lord s thy god  the earth  also   with all that therein  is    
   only the lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them  and he chose their seed after them   even  you above all people  as  it is  this day   
   circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart  and be no more stiffnecked   
   for the lord your god  is  god of gods  and lord of lords  a great god  a mighty  and a terrible  which regardeth not persons  nor taketh reward   
   he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow  and loveth the stranger  in giving him food and raiment   
   love ye therefore the stranger  for ye were strangers in the land of egypt   
   thou shalt fear the lord thy god  him shalt thou serve  and to him shalt thou cleave  and swear by his name   
   he  is  thy praise  and he  is  thy god  that hath done for thee these great and terrible things  which thine eyes have seen   
   thy fathers went down into egypt with threescore and ten persons  and now the lord thy god hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude   
deuteronmy    
   therefore thou shalt love the lord thy god  and keep his charge  and his statutes  and his judgments  and his commandments  alway   
  and know ye this day  for  i speak  not with your children which have not known  and which have not seen the chastisement of the lord your god  his greatness  his mighty hand  and his stretched out arm   
  and his miracles  and his acts  which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt  and unto all his land   
  and what he did unto the army of egypt  unto their horses  and to their chariots  how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you  and  how  the lord hath destroyed them unto this day   
  and what he did unto you in the wilderness  until ye came into this place   
  and what he did unto dathan and abiram  the sons of eliab  the son of reuben  how the earth opened her mouth  and swallowed them up  and their households  and their tents  and all the substance that  was  in their possession  in the midst of all israel   
  but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the lord which he did   
   therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which i command you this day  that ye may be strong  and go in and possess the land  whither ye go to possess it   
  and that ye may prolong  your  days in the land  which the lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed  a land that floweth with milk and honey   
   for the land  whither thou goest in to possess it   is  not as the land of egypt  from whence ye came out  where thou sowedst thy seed  and wateredst  it  with thy foot  as a garden of herbs   
   but the land  whither ye go to possess it   is  a land of hills and valleys   and  drinketh water of the rain of heaven   
   a land which the lord thy god careth for  the eyes of the lord thy god  are  always upon it  from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year   
   and it shall come to pass  if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which i command you this day  to love the lord your god  and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul   
   that i will give  you  the rain of your land in his due season  the first rain and the latter rain  that thou mayest gather in thy corn  and thy wine  and thine oil   
   and i will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle  that thou mayest eat and be full   
   take heed to yourselves  that your heart be not deceived  and ye turn aside  and serve other gods  and worship them   
   and  then  the lord s wrath be kindled against you  and he shut up the heaven  that there be no rain  and that the land yield not her fruit  and  lest  ye perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you   
    therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul  and bind them for a sign upon your hand  that they may be as frontlets between your eyes   
   and ye shall teach them your children  speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house  and when thou walkest by the way  when thou liest down  and when thou risest up   
   and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house  and upon thy gates   
   that your days may be multiplied  and the days of your children  in the land which the lord sware unto your fathers to give them  as the days of heaven upon the earth   
   for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which i command you  to do them  to love the lord your god  to walk in all his ways  and to cleave unto him   
   then will the lord drive out all these nations from before you  and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves   
   every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours  from the wilderness and lebanon  from the river  the river euphrates  even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be   
   there shall no man be able to stand before you   for  the lord your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon  as he hath said unto you   
    behold  i set before you this day a blessing and a curse   
   a blessing  if ye obey the commandments of the lord your god  which i command you this day   
   and a curse  if ye will not obey the commandments of the lord your god  but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day  to go after other gods  which ye have not known   
   and it shall come to pass  when the lord thy god hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it  that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount gerizim  and the curse upon mount ebal   
    are  they not on the other side jordan  by the way where the sun goeth down  in the land of the canaanites  which dwell in the champaign over against gilgal  beside the plains of moreh   
   for ye shall pass over jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you  and ye shall possess it  and dwell therein   
   and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which i set before you this day   
deuteronmy    
   these  are  the statutes and judgments  which ye shall observe to do in the land  which the lord god of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it  all the days that ye live upon the earth   
  ye shall utterly destroy all the places  wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods  upon the high mountains  and upon the hills  and under every green tree   
  and ye shall overthrow their altars  and break their pillars  and burn their groves with fire  and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods  and destroy the names of them out of that place   
  ye shall not do so unto the lord your god   
   but unto the place which the lord your god shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there   even  unto his habitation shall ye seek  and thither thou shalt come   
  and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings  and your sacrifices  and your tithes  and heave offerings of your hand  and your vows  and your freewill offerings  and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks   
  and there ye shall eat before the lord your god  and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto  ye and your households  wherein the lord thy god hath blessed thee   
  ye shall not do after all  the things  that we do here this day  every man whatsoever  is  right in his own eyes   
  for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance  which the lord your god giveth you   
   but  when  ye go over jordan  and dwell in the land which the lord your god giveth you to inherit  and  when  he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about  so that ye dwell in safety   
   then there shall be a place which the lord your god shall choose to cause his name to dwell there  thither shall ye bring all that i command you  your burnt offerings  and your sacrifices  your tithes  and the heave offering of your hand  and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the lord   
   and ye shall rejoice before the lord your god  ye  and your sons  and your daughters  and your menservants  and your maidservants  and the levite that  is  within your gates  forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you   
   take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest   
   but in the place which the lord shall choose in one of thy tribes  there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings  and there thou shalt do all that i command thee   
   notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates  whatsoever thy soul lusteth after  according to the blessing of the lord thy god which he hath given thee  the unclean and the clean may eat thereof  as of the roebuck  and as of the hart   
   only ye shall not eat the blood  ye shall pour it upon the earth as water   
   thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn  or of thy wine  or of thy oil  or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock  nor any of thy vows which thou vowest  nor thy freewill offerings  or heave offering of thine hand   
   but thou must eat them before the lord thy god in the place which the lord thy god shall choose  thou  and thy son  and thy daughter  and thy manservant  and thy maidservant  and the levite that  is  within thy gates  and thou shalt rejoice before the lord thy god in all that thou puttest thine hands unto   
   take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as thou livest upon the earth   
   when the lord thy god shall enlarge thy border  as he hath promised thee  and thou shalt say  i will eat flesh  because thy soul longeth to eat flesh  thou mayest eat flesh  whatsoever thy soul lusteth after   
   if the place which the lord thy god hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee  then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock  which the lord hath given thee  as i have commanded thee  and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after   
   even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten  so thou shalt eat them  the unclean and the clean shall eat  of  them alike   
   only be sure that thou eat not the blood  for the blood  is  the life  and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh   
   thou shalt not eat it  thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water   
   thou shalt not eat it  that it may go well with thee  and with thy children after thee  when thou shalt do  that which is  right in the sight of the lord   
   only thy holy things which thou hast  and thy vows  thou shalt take  and go unto the place which the lord shall choose   
   and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings  the flesh and the blood  upon the altar of the lord thy god  and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the lord thy god  and thou shalt eat the flesh   
   observe and hear all these words which i command thee  that it may go well with thee  and with thy children after thee for ever  when thou doest  that which is  good and right in the sight of the lord thy god   
   when the lord thy god shall cut off the nations from before thee  whither thou goest to possess them  and thou succeedest them  and dwellest in their land   
   take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them  after that they be destroyed from before thee  and that thou enquire not after their gods  saying  how did these nations serve their gods  even so will i do likewise   
   thou shalt not do so unto the lord thy god  for every abomination to the lord  which he hateth  have they done unto their gods  for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods   
   what thing soever i command you  observe to do it  thou shalt not add thereto  nor diminish from it

  and every beast that parteth the hoof  and cleaveth the cleft into two claws   and  cheweth the cud among the beasts  that ye shall eat   
  nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud  or of them that divide the cloven hoof   as  the camel  and the hare  and the coney  for they chew the cud  but divide not the hoof   therefore  they  are  unclean unto you   
  and the swine  because it divideth the hoof  yet cheweth not the cud  it  is  unclean unto you  ye shall not eat of their flesh  nor touch their dead carcase

   ye shall not eat  of  any thing that dieth of itself  thou shalt give it unto the stranger that  is  in thy gates  that he may eat it  or thou mayest sell it unto an alien  for thou  art  an holy people unto the lord thy god  thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother s milk   
    thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed  that the field bringeth forth year by year

   and if the way be too long for thee  so that thou art not able to carry it   or  if the place be too far from thee  which the lord thy god shall choose to set his name there  when the lord thy god hath blessed thee

  of a foreigner thou mayest exact  it again   but  that  which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release   
  save when there shall be no poor among you  for the lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee  for  an inheritance to possess it   
  only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god  to observe to do all these commandments which i command thee this day   
  for the lord thy god blesseth thee  as he promised thee  and thou shalt lend unto many nations  but thou shalt not borrow  and thou shalt reign over many nations  but they shall not reign over thee   
  if there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee  thou shalt not harden thine heart  nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother

  beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart  saying  the seventh year  the year of release  is at hand  and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother  and thou givest him nought  and he cry unto the lord against thee  and it be sin unto thee   
   thou shalt surely give him  and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him  because that for this thing the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thy works  and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto   
   for the poor shall never cease out of the land  therefore i command thee  saying  thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother  to thy poor  and to thy needy  in thy land   
     and  if thy brother  an hebrew man  or an hebrew woman  be sold unto thee  and serve thee six years  then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee

   thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock  and out of thy floor  and out of thy winepress   of that  wherewith the lord thy god hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him   
   and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt  and the lord thy god redeemed thee  therefore i command thee this thing to day   
   and it shall be  if he say unto thee  i will not go away from thee  because he loveth thee and thine house  because he is well with thee   
   then thou shalt take an aul  and thrust  it  through his ear unto the door  and he shall be thy servant for ever  and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise   
   it shall not seem hard unto thee  when thou sendest him away free from thee  for he hath been worth a double hired servant  to thee   in serving thee six years  and the lord thy god shall bless thee in all that thou doest   
    all the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the lord thy god  thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock  nor shear the firstling of thy sheep

  thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it  seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith   even  the bread of affliction  for thou camest forth out of the land of egypt in haste  that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of egypt all the days of thy life   
  and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days  neither shall there  any thing  of the flesh  which thou sacrificedst the first day at even  remain all night until the morning   
  thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates  which the lord thy god giveth thee

   seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the lord thy god in the place which the lord shall choose  because the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thine increase  and in all the works of thine hands  therefore thou shalt surely rejoice   
   three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose  in the feast of unleavened bread  and in the feast of weeks  and in the feast of tabernacles  and they shall not appear before the lord empty

  and hath gone and served other gods  and worshipped them  either the sun  or moon  or any of the host of heaven  which i have not commanded   
  and it be told thee  and thou hast heard  of it   and enquired diligently  and  behold   it be  true   and  the thing certain   that  such abomination is wrought in israel

  at the mouth of two witnesses  or three witnesses  shall he that is worthy of death be put to death   but  at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death   
  the hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death  and afterward the hands of all the people  so thou shalt put the evil away from among you   
   if there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment  between blood and blood  between plea and plea  and between stroke and stroke   being  matters of controversy within thy gates  then shalt thou arise  and get thee up into the place which the lord thy god shall choose

   and thou shalt do according to the sentence  which they of that place which the lord shall choose shall shew thee  and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee   
   according to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee  and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee  thou shalt do  thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee   to  the right hand  nor  to  the left

   neither shall he multiply wives to himself  that his heart turn not away  neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold   
   and it shall be  when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom  that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of  that which is  before the priests the levites

  and this shall be the priest s due from the people  from them that offer a sacrifice  whether  it be  ox or sheep  and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder  and the two cheeks  and the maw   
  the firstfruit  also  of thy corn  of thy wine  and of thine oil  and the first of the fleece of thy sheep  shalt thou give him   
  for the lord thy god hath chosen him out of all thy tribes  to stand to minister in the name of the lord  him and his sons for ever   
  and if a levite come from any of thy gates out of all israel  where he sojourned  and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the lord shall choose   
  then he shall minister in the name of the lord his god  as all his brethren the levites  do   which stand there before the lord   
  they shall have like portions to eat  beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony   
   when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god giveth thee  thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations   
   there shall not be found among you  any one  that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire   or  that useth divination   or  an observer of times  or an enchanter  or a witch   
   or a charmer  or a consulter with familiar spirits  or a wizard  or a necromancer   
   for all that do these things  are  an abomination unto the lord  and because of these abominations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee   
   thou shalt be perfect with the lord thy god   
   for these nations  which thou shalt possess  hearkened unto observers of times  and unto diviners  but as for thee  the lord thy god hath not suffered thee so  to do    
    the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee  of thy brethren  like unto me  unto him ye shall hearken   
   according to all that thou desiredst of the lord thy god in horeb in the day of the assembly  saying  let me not hear again the voice of the lord my god  neither let me see this great fire any more  that i die not   
   and the lord said unto me  they have well  spoken that  which they have spoken   
   i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren  like unto thee  and will put my words in his mouth  and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him   
   and it shall come to pass   that  whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name  i will require  it  of him   
   but the prophet  which shall presume to speak a word in my name  which i have not commanded him to speak  or that shall speak in the name of other gods  even that prophet shall die   
   and if thou say in thine heart  how shall we know the word which the lord hath not spoken   
   when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord  if the thing follow not  nor come to pass  that  is  the thing which the lord hath not spoken   but  the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously  thou shalt not be afraid of him

   when the lord thy god hath cut off the nations  whose land the lord thy god giveth thee  and thou succeedest them  and dwellest in their cities  and in their houses   
  thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land  which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it   
  thou shalt prepare thee a way  and divide the coasts of thy land  which the lord thy god giveth thee to inherit  into three parts  that every slayer may flee thither   
  and this  is  the case of the slayer  which shall flee thither  that he may live  whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly  whom he hated not in time past   
  as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood  and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree  and the head slippeth from the helve  and lighteth upon his neighbour  that he die  he shall flee unto one of those cities  and live   
  lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer  while his heart is hot  and overtake him  because the way is long  and slay him  whereas he  was  not worthy of death  inasmuch as he hated him not in time past   
  wherefore i command thee  saying  thou shalt separate three cities for thee   
  and if the lord thy god enlarge thy coast  as he hath sworn unto thy fathers  and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers   
  if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them  which i command thee this day  to love the lord thy god  and to walk ever in his ways  then shalt thou add three cities more for thee  beside these three   
   that innocent blood be not shed in thy land  which the lord thy god giveth thee  for  an inheritance  and  so  blood be upon thee   
   but if any man hate his neighbour  and lie in wait for him  and rise up against him  and smite him mortally that he die  and fleeth into one of these cities   
   then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence  and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood  that he may die   
   thine eye shall not pity him  but thou shalt put away  the guilt of  innocent blood from israel  that it may go well with thee   
    thou shalt not remove thy neighbour s landmark  which they of old time have set in thine inheritance  which thou shalt inherit in the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it   
   one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity  or for any sin  in any sin that he sinneth  at the mouth of two witnesses  or at the mouth of three witnesses  shall the matter be established   
   if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him  that which is  wrong   
   then both the men  between whom the controversy  is   shall stand before the lord  before the priests and the judges  which shall be in those days   
   and the judges shall make diligent inquisition  and  behold   if  the witness  be  a false witness   and  hath testified falsely against his brother   
   then shall ye do unto him  as he had thought to have done unto his brother  so shalt thou put the evil away from among you   
   and those which remain shall hear  and fear  and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you

   that they teach you not to do after all their abominations  which they have done unto their gods  so should ye sin against the lord your god   
   when thou shalt besiege a city a long time  in making war against it to take it  thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them  for thou mayest eat of them  and thou shalt not cut them down  for the tree of the field  is  man s  life   to employ  them  in the siege

   he shall lend to thee  and thou shalt not lend to him  he shall be the head  and thou shalt be the tail   
    moreover all these curses shall come upon thee  and shall pursue thee  and overtake thee  till thou be destroyed  because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the lord thy god  to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee   
   and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder  and upon thy seed for ever   
   because thou servedst not the lord thy god with joyfulness  and with gladness of heart  for the abundance of all  things    
   therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the lord shall send against thee  in hunger  and in thirst  and in nakedness  and in want of all  things   and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck  until he have destroyed thee   
   the lord shall bring a nation against thee from far  from the end of the earth   as swift  as the eagle flieth  a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand   
   a nation of fierce countenance  which shall not regard the person of the old  nor shew favour to the young   
   and he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle  and the fruit of thy land  until thou be destroyed  which  also  shall not leave thee  either  corn  wine  or oil   or  the increase of thy kine  or flocks of thy sheep  until he have destroyed thee   
   and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates  until thy high and fenced walls come down  wherein thou trustedst  throughout all thy land  and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land  which the lord thy god hath given thee   
   and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body  the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters  which the lord thy god hath given thee  in the siege  and in the straitness  wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee   
    so that  the man  that is  tender among you  and very delicate  his eye shall be evil toward his brother  and toward the wife of his bosom  and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave   
   so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat  because he hath nothing left him in the siege  and in the straitness  wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates   
   the tender and delicate woman among you  which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness  her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom  and toward her son  and toward her daughter   
   and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet  and toward her children which she shall bear  for she shall eat them for want of all  things  secretly in the siege and straitness  wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates   
   if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book  that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name  the lord thy god   
   then the lord will make thy plagues wonderful  and the plagues of thy seed   even  great plagues  and of long continuance  and sore sicknesses  and of long continuance   
   moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of egypt  which thou wast afraid of  and they shall cleave unto thee   
   also every sickness  and every plague  which  is  not written in the book of this law  them will the lord bring upon thee  until thou be destroyed   
   and ye shall be left few in number  whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude  because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the lord thy god   
   and it shall come to pass   that  as the lord rejoiced over you to do you good  and to multiply you  so the lord will rejoice over you to destroy you  and to bring you to nought  and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it   
   and the lord shall scatter thee among all people  from the one end of the earth even unto the other  and there thou shalt serve other gods  which neither thou nor thy fathers have known   even  wood and stone   
   and among these nations shalt thou find no ease  neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest  but the lord shall give thee there a trembling heart  and failing of eyes  and sorrow of mind   
   and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee  and thou shalt fear day and night  and shalt have none assurance of thy life   
   in the morning thou shalt say  would god it were even  and at even thou shalt say  would god it were morning  for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear  and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see   
   and the lord shall bring thee into egypt again with ships  by the way whereof i spake unto thee  thou shalt see it no more again  and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen  and no man shall buy  you    
deuteronmy    
   these  are  the words of the covenant  which the lord commanded moses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab  beside the covenant which he made with them in horeb   
  and moses called unto all israel  and said unto them  ye have seen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt unto pharaoh  and unto all his servants  and unto all his land   
  the great temptations which thine eyes have seen  the signs  and those great miracles   
  yet the lord hath not given you an heart to perceive  and eyes to see  and ears to hear  unto this day   
  and i have led you forty years in the wilderness  your clothes are not waxen old upon you  and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot   
  ye have not eaten bread  neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink  that ye might know that i  am  the lord your god   
  and when ye came unto this place  sihon the king of heshbon  and og the king of bashan  came out against us unto battle  and we smote them   
  and we took their land  and gave it for an inheritance unto the reubenites  and to the gadites  and to the half tribe of manasseh   
  keep therefore the words of this covenant  and do them  that ye may prosper in all that ye do   
    ye stand this day all of you before the lord your god  your captains of your tribes  your elders  and your officers   with  all the men of israel   
   your little ones  your wives  and thy stranger that  is  in thy camp  from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water   
   that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the lord thy god  and into his oath  which the lord thy god maketh with thee this day   
   that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself  and  that  he may be unto thee a god  as he hath said unto thee  and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers  to abraham  to isaac  and to jacob   
   neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath   
   but with  him  that standeth here with us this day before the lord our god  and also with  him  that  is  not here with us this day   
    for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of egypt  and how we came through the nations which ye passed by   
   and ye have seen their abominations  and their idols  wood and stone  silver and gold  which  were  among them    
   lest there should be among you man  or woman  or family  or tribe  whose heart turneth away this day from the lord our god  to go  and  serve the gods of these nations  lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood   
   and it come to pass  when he heareth the words of this curse  that he bless himself in his heart  saying  i shall have peace  though i walk in the imagination of mine heart  to add drunkenness to thirst   
   the lord will not spare him  but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man  and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him  and the lord shall blot out his name from under heaven   
   and the lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of israel  according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law   
   so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you  and the stranger that shall come from a far land  shall say  when they see the plagues of that land  and the sicknesses which the lord hath laid upon it   
    and that  the whole land thereof  is  brimstone  and salt   and  burning   that  it is not sown  nor beareth  nor any grass groweth therein  like the overthrow of sodom  and gomorrah  admah  and zeboim  which the lord overthrew in his anger  and in his wrath   
   even all nations shall say  wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this land  what  meaneth  the heat of this great anger   
   then men shall say  because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord god of their fathers  which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of egypt   
   for they went and served other gods  and worshipped them  gods whom they knew not  and  whom  he had not given unto them   
   and the anger of the lord was kindled against this land  to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book   
   and the lord rooted them out of their land in anger  and in wrath  and in great indignation  and cast them into another land  as  it is  this day   
   the secret  things belong  unto the lord our god  but those  things which are  revealed  belong  unto us and to our children for ever  that  we  may do all the words of this law   
deuteronmy    
   and it shall come to pass  when all these things are come upon thee  the blessing and the curse  which i have set before thee  and thou shalt call  them  to mind among all the nations  whither the lord thy god hath driven thee   
  and shalt return unto the lord thy god  and shalt obey his voice according to all that i command thee this day  thou and thy children  with all thine heart  and with all thy soul   
  that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity  and have compassion upon thee  and will return and gather thee from all the nations  whither the lord thy god hath scattered thee   
  if  any  of thine be driven out unto the outmost  parts  of heaven  from thence will the lord thy god gather thee  and from thence will he fetch thee   
  and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed  and thou shalt possess it  and he will do thee good  and multiply thee above thy fathers   
  and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart  and the heart of thy seed  to love the lord thy god with all thine heart  and with all thy soul  that thou mayest live   
  and the lord thy god will put all these curses upon thine enemies  and on them that hate thee  which persecuted thee   
  and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord  and do all his commandments which i command thee this day   
  and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand  in the fruit of thy body  and in the fruit of thy cattle  and in the fruit of thy land  for good  for the lord will again rejoice over thee for good  as he rejoiced over thy fathers   
   if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god  to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law   and  if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart  and with all thy soul   
    for this commandment which i command thee this day  it  is  not hidden from thee  neither  is  it far off   
   it  is  not in heaven  that thou shouldest say  who shall go up for us to heaven  and bring it unto us  that we may hear it  and do it   
   neither  is  it beyond the sea  that thou shouldest say  who shall go over the sea for us  and bring it unto us  that we may hear it  and do it   
   but the word  is  very nigh unto thee  in thy mouth  and in thy heart  that thou mayest do it   
    see  i have set before thee this day life and good  and death and evil   
   in that i command thee this day to love the lord thy god  to walk in his ways  and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments  that thou mayest live and multiply  and the lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it   
   but if thine heart turn away  so that thou wilt not hear  but shalt be drawn away  and worship other gods  and serve them   
   i denounce unto you this day  that ye shall surely perish   and that  ye shall not prolong  your  days upon the land  whither thou passest over jordan to go to possess it   
   i call heaven and earth to record this day against you   that  i have set before you life and death  blessing and cursing  therefore choose life  that both thou and thy seed may live   
   that thou mayest love the lord thy god   and  that thou mayest obey his voice  and that thou mayest cleave unto him  for he  is  thy life  and the length of thy days  that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord sware unto thy fathers  to abraham  to isaac  and to jacob  to give them

   and moses went and spake these words unto all israel   
  and he said unto them  i  am  an hundred and twenty years old this day  i can no more go out and come in  also the lord hath said unto me  thou shalt not go over this jordan   
  the lord thy god  he will go over before thee   and  he will destroy these nations from before thee  and thou shalt possess them   and  joshua  he shall go over before thee  as the lord hath said   
  and the lord shall do unto them as he did to sihon and to og  kings of the amorites  and unto the land of them  whom he destroyed   
  and the lord shall give them up before your face  that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which i have commanded you   
  be strong and of a good courage  fear not  nor be afraid of them  for the lord thy god  he  it is  that doth go with thee  he will not fail thee  nor forsake thee   
  and moses called unto joshua  and said unto him in the sight of all israel  be strong and of a good courage  for thou must go with this people unto the land which the lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them  and thou shalt cause them to inherit it   
  and the lord  he  it is  that doth go before thee  he will be with thee  he will not fail thee  neither forsake thee  fear not  neither be dismayed   
   and moses wrote this law  and delivered it unto the priests the sons of levi  which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord  and unto all the elders of israel   
   and moses commanded them  saying  at the end of  every  seven years  in the solemnity of the year of release  in the feast of tabernacles   
   when all israel is come to appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose  thou shalt read this law before all israel in their hearing   
   gather the people together  men  and women  and children  and thy stranger that  is  within thy gates  that they may hear  and that they may learn  and fear the lord your god  and observe to do all the words of this law   
   and  that  their children  which have not known  any thing   may hear  and learn to fear the lord your god  as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it   
    and the lord said unto moses  behold  thy days approach that thou must die  call joshua  and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation  that i may give him a charge  and moses and joshua went  and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation   
   and the lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud  and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle   
   and the lord said unto moses  behold  thou shalt sleep with thy fathers  and this people will rise up  and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land  whither they go  to be  among them  and will forsake me  and break my covenant which i have made with them   
   then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day  and i will forsake them  and i will hide my face from them  and they shall be devoured  and many evils and troubles shall befall them  so that they will say in that day  are not these evils come upon us  because our god  is  not among us   
   and i will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought  in that they are turned unto other gods   
   now therefore write ye this song for you  and teach it the children of israel  put it in their mouths  that this song may be a witness for me against the children of israel   
   for when i shall have brought them into the land which i sware unto their fathers  that floweth with milk and honey  and they shall have eaten and filled themselves  and waxen fat  then will they turn unto other gods  and serve them  and provoke me  and break my covenant   
   and it shall come to pass  when many evils and troubles are befallen them  that this song shall testify against them as a witness  for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed  for i know their imagination which they go about  even now  before i have brought them into the land which i sware   
    moses therefore wrote this song the same day  and taught it the children of israel   
   and he gave joshua the son of nun a charge  and said  be strong and of a good courage  for thou shalt bring the children of israel into the land which i sware unto them  and i will be with thee   
   and it came to pass  when moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book  until they were finished   
   that moses commanded the levites  which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord  saying   
   take this book of the law  and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the lord your god  that it may be there for a witness against thee   
   for i know thy rebellion  and thy stiff neck  behold  while i am yet alive with you this day  ye have been rebellious against the lord  and how much more after my death   
   gather unto me all the elders of your tribes  and your officers  that i may speak these words in their ears  and call heaven and earth to record against them   
   for i know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt  yourselves   and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you  and evil will befall you in the latter days  because ye will do evil in the sight of the lord  to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands   
   and moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of israel the words of this song  until they were ended   
deuteronmy    
   give ear  o ye heavens  and i will speak  and hear  o earth  the words of my mouth   
  my doctrine shall drop as the rain  my speech shall distil as the dew  as the small rain upon the tender herb  and as the showers upon the grass   
  because i will publish the name of the lord  ascribe ye greatness unto our god   
   he is  the rock  his work  is  perfect  for all his ways  are  judgment  a god of truth and without iniquity  just and right  is  he   
  they have corrupted themselves  their spot  is  not  the spot  of his children   they are  a perverse and crooked generation   
  do ye thus requite the lord  o foolish people and unwise   is  not he thy father  that  hath bought thee  hath he not made thee  and established thee   
   remember the days of old  consider the years of many generations  ask thy father  and he will shew thee  thy elders  and they will tell thee   
  when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance  when he separated the sons of adam  he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of israel   
  for the lord s portion  is  his people  jacob  is  the lot of his inheritance   
   he found him in a desert land  and in the waste howling wilderness  he led him about  he instructed him  he kept him as the apple of his eye   
   as an eagle stirreth up her nest  fluttereth over her young  spreadeth abroad her wings  taketh them  beareth them on her wings   
    so  the lord alone did lead him  and  there was  no strange god with him   
   he made him ride on the high places of the earth  that he might eat the increase of the fields  and he made him to suck honey out of the rock  and oil out of the flinty rock   
   butter of kine  and milk of sheep  with fat of lambs  and rams of the breed of bashan  and goats  with the fat of kidneys of wheat  and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape   
    but jeshurun waxed fat  and kicked  thou art waxen fat  thou art grown thick  thou art covered  with fatness   then he forsook god  which  made him  and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation   
   they provoked him to jealousy with strange  gods   with abominations provoked they him to anger   
   they sacrificed unto devils  not to god  to gods whom they knew not  to new  gods that  came newly up  whom your fathers feared not   
   of the rock  that  begat thee thou art unmindful  and hast forgotten god that formed thee   
    and when the lord saw  it   he abhorred  them   because of the provoking of his sons  and of his daughters   
   and he said  i will hide my face from them  i will see what their end  shall be   for they  are  a very froward generation  children in whom  is  no faith   
   they have moved me to jealousy with  that which is  not god  they have provoked me to anger with their vanities  and i will move them to jealousy with  those which are  not a people  i will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation   
   for a fire is kindled in mine anger  and shall burn unto the lowest hell  and shall consume the earth with her increase  and set on fire the foundations of the mountains   
   i will heap mischiefs upon them  i will spend mine arrows upon them   
    they shall be  burnt with hunger  and devoured with burning heat  and with bitter destruction  i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them  with the poison of serpents of the dust   
   the sword without  and terror within  shall destroy both the young man and the virgin  the suckling  also  with the man of gray hairs   
    i said  i would scatter them into corners  i would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men   
   were it not that i feared the wrath of the enemy  lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely   and  lest they should say  our hand  is  high  and the lord hath not done all this   
   for they  are  a nation void of counsel  neither  is there any  understanding in them   
   o that they were wise   that  they understood this   that  they would consider their latter end   
   how should one chase a thousand  and two put ten thousand to flight  except their rock had sold them  and the lord had shut them up   
   for their rock  is  not as our rock  even our enemies themselves  being  judges   
   for their vine  is  of the vine of sodom  and of the fields of gomorrah  their grapes  are  grapes of gall  their clusters  are  bitter   
   their wine  is  the poison of dragons  and the cruel venom of asps   
    is  not this laid up in store with me   and  sealed up among my treasures   
   to me  belongeth  vengeance  and recompence  their foot shall slide in  due  time  for the day of their calamity  is  at hand  and the things that shall come upon them make haste   
   for the lord shall judge his people  and repent himself for his servants  when he seeth that  their  power is gone  and  there is  none shut up  or left   
   and he shall say  where  are  their gods   their  rock in whom they trusted   
   which did eat the fat of their sacrifices   and  drank the wine of their drink offerings  let them rise up and help you   and  be your protection   
    see now that i   even  i   am  he  and  there is  no god with me  i kill  and i make alive  i wound  and i heal  neither  is there any  that can deliver out of my hand   
   for i lift up my hand to heaven  and say  i live for ever   
   if i whet my glittering sword  and mine hand take hold on judgment  i will render vengeance to mine enemies  and will reward them that hate me   
   i will make mine arrows drunk with blood  and my sword shall devour flesh   and that  with the blood of the slain and of the captives  from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy   
   rejoice  o ye nations   with  his people  for he will avenge the blood of his servants  and will render vengeance to his adversaries  and will be merciful unto his land   and  to his people   
    and moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people  he  and hoshea the son of nun   
   and moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel   
   and he said unto them  set your hearts unto all the words which i testify among you this day  which ye shall command your children to observe to do  all the words of this law   
   for it  is  not a vain thing for you  because it  is  your life  and through this thing ye shall prolong  your  days in the land  whither ye go over jordan to possess it   
   and the lord spake unto moses that selfsame day  saying   
   get thee up into this mountain abarim   unto  mount nebo  which  is  in the land of moab  that  is  over against jericho  and behold the land of canaan  which i give unto the children of israel for a possession   
   and die in the mount whither thou goest up  and be gathered unto thy people  as aaron thy brother died in mount hor  and was gathered unto his people   
   because ye trespassed against me among the children of israel at the waters of meribah kadesh  in the wilderness of zin  because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of israel   
   yet thou shalt see the land before  thee   but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which i give the children of israel   
deuteronmy    
   and this  is  the blessing  wherewith moses the man of god blessed the children of israel before his death   
  and he said  the lord came from sinai  and rose up from seir unto them  he shined forth from mount paran  and he came with ten thousands of saints  from his right hand  went  a fiery law for them   
  yea  he loved the people  all his saints  are  in thy hand  and they sat down at thy feet   every one  shall receive of thy words   
  moses commanded us a law   even  the inheritance of the congregation of jacob   
  and he was king in jeshurun  when the heads of the people  and  the tribes of israel were gathered together   
   let reuben live  and not die  and let  not  his men be few   
  and this  is the blessing  of judah  and he said  hear  lord  the voice of judah  and bring him unto his people  let his hands be sufficient for him  and be thou an help  to him  from his enemies   
   and of levi he said   let  thy thummim and thy urim  be  with thy holy one  whom thou didst prove at massah   and with  whom thou didst strive at the waters of meribah   
  who said unto his father and to his mother  i have not seen him  neither did he acknowledge his brethren  nor knew his own children  for they have observed thy word  and kept thy covenant   
   they shall teach jacob thy judgments  and israel thy law  they shall put incense before thee  and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar   
   bless  lord  his substance  and accept the work of his hands  smite through the loins of them that rise against him  and of them that hate him  that they rise not again   
     and  of benjamin he said  the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by him   and the lord  shall cover him all the day long  and he shall dwell between his shoulders   
   and of joseph he said  blessed of the lord  be  his land  for the precious things of heaven  for the dew  and for the deep that coucheth beneath   
   and for the precious fruits  brought forth  by the sun  and for the precious things put forth by the moon   
   and for the chief things of the ancient mountains  and for the precious things of the lasting hills   
   and for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof  and  for  the good will of him that dwelt in the bush  let  the blessing  come upon the head of joseph  and upon the top of the head of him  that was  separated from his brethren   
   his glory  is like  the firstling of his bullock  and his horns  are like  the horns of unicorns  with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth  and they  are  the ten thousands of ephraim  and they  are  the thousands of manasseh   
    and of zebulun he said  rejoice  zebulun  in thy going out  and  issachar  in thy tents   
   they shall call the people unto the mountain  there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness  for they shall suck  of  the abundance of the seas  and  of  treasures hid in the sand   
   and of gad he said  blessed  be  he that enlargeth gad  he dwelleth as a lion  and teareth the arm with the crown of the head   
   and he provided the first part for himself  because there   in  a portion of the lawgiver   was he  seated  and he came with the heads of the people  he executed the justice of the lord  and his judgments with israel   
    and of dan he said  dan  is  a lion s whelp  he shall leap from bashan   
   and of naphtali he said  o naphtali  satisfied with favour  and full with the blessing of the lord  possess thou the west and the south   
   and of asher he said   let  asher  be  blessed with children  let him be acceptable to his brethren  and let him dip his foot in oil   
   thy shoes  shall be  iron and brass  and as thy days   so shall  thy strength  be    
     there is  none like unto the god of jeshurun   who  rideth upon the heaven in thy help  and in his excellency on the sky   
   the eternal god  is thy  refuge  and underneath  are  the everlasting arms  and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee  and shall say  destroy  them    
   israel then shall dwell in safety alone  the fountain of jacob  shall be  upon a land of corn and wine  also his heavens shall drop down dew   
   happy  art  thou  o israel  who  is  like unto thee  o people saved by the lord  the shield of thy help  and who  is  the sword of thy excellency  and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee  and thou shalt tread upon their high places   
deuteronmy    
   and moses went up from the plains of moab unto the mountain of nebo  to the top of pisgah  that  is  over against jericho  and the lord shewed him all the land of gilead  unto dan   
  and all naphtali  and the land of ephraim  and manasseh  and all the land of judah  unto the utmost sea   
  and the south  and the plain of the valley of jericho  the city of palm trees  unto zoar   
  and the lord said unto him  this  is  the land which i sware unto abraham  unto isaac  and unto jacob  saying  i will give it unto thy seed  i have caused thee to see  it  with thine eyes  but thou shalt not go over thither   
   so moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moab  according to the word of the lord   
  and he buried him in a valley in the land of moab  over against bethpeor  but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day   
  and moses  was  an hundred and twenty years old when he died  his eye was not dim  nor his natural force abated   
  and the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moab thirty days  so the days of weeping  and  mourning for moses were ended   
   and joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom  for moses had laid his hands upon him  and the children of israel hearkened unto him  and did as the lord commanded moses   
   and there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto moses  whom the lord knew face to face   
   in all the signs and the wonders  which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh  and to all his servants  and to all his land   
   and in all that mighty hand  and in all the great terror which moses shewed in the sight of all israel   
 
joshua 
joshua   
   now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass  that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun  moses  minister  saying   
  moses my servant is dead  now therefore arise  go over this jordan  thou  and all this people  unto the land which i do give to them   even  to the children of israel   
  every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon  that have i given unto you  as i said unto moses   
  from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river  the river euphrates  all the land of the hittites  and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun  shall be your coast   
  there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life  as i was with moses   so  i will be with thee  i will not fail thee  nor forsake thee   
  be strong and of a good courage  for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land  which i sware unto their fathers to give them   
  only be thou strong and very courageous  that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law  which moses my servant commanded thee  turn not from it  to  the right hand or  to  the left  that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest   
  this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth  but thou shalt meditate therein day and night  that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein  for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous  and then thou shalt have good success   
  have not i commanded thee  be strong and of a good courage  be not afraid  neither be thou dismayed  for the lord thy god  is  with thee whithersoever thou goest   
    then joshua commanded the officers of the people  saying   
   pass through the host  and command the people  saying  prepare you victuals  for within three days ye shall pass over this jordan  to go in to possess the land  which the lord your god giveth you to possess it   
   and to the reubenites  and to the gadites  and to half the tribe of manasseh  spake joshua  saying   
   remember the word which moses the servant of the lord commanded you  saying  the lord your god hath given you rest  and hath given you this land   
   your wives  your little ones  and your cattle  shall remain in the land which moses gave you on this side jordan  but ye shall pass before your brethren armed  all the mighty men of valour  and help them   
   until the lord have given your brethren rest  as  he hath given  you  and they also have possessed the land which the lord your god giveth them  then ye shall return unto the land of your possession  and enjoy it  which moses the lord s servant gave you on this side jordan toward the sunrising   
    and they answered joshua  saying  all that thou commandest us we will do  and whithersoever thou sendest us  we will go   
   according as we hearkened unto moses in all things  so will we hearken unto thee  only the lord thy god be with thee  as he was with moses   
   whosoever  he be  that doth rebel against thy commandment  and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him  he shall be put to death  only be strong and of a good courage   
joshua   
   and joshua the son of nun sent out of shittim two men to spy secretly  saying  go view the land  even jericho  and they went  and came into an harlot s house  named rahab  and lodged there   
  and it was told the king of jericho  saying  behold  there came men in hither to night of the children of israel to search out the country   
  and the king of jericho sent unto rahab  saying  bring forth the men that are come to thee  which are entered into thine house  for they be come to search out all the country   
  and the woman took the two men  and hid them  and said thus  there came men unto me  but i wist not whence they  were    
  and it came to pass  about the time  of shutting of the gate  when it was dark  that the men went out  whither the men went i wot not  pursue after them quickly  for ye shall overtake them   
  but she had brought them up to the roof of the house  and hid them with the stalks of flax  which she had laid in order upon the roof   
  and the men pursued after them the way to jordan unto the fords  and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out  they shut the gate   
   and before they were laid down  she came up unto them upon the roof   
  and she said unto the men  i know that the lord hath given you the land  and that your terror is fallen upon us  and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you   
   for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you  when ye came out of egypt  and what ye did unto the two kings of the amorites  that  were  on the other side jordan  sihon and og  whom ye utterly destroyed   
   and as soon as we had heard  these things   our hearts did melt  neither did there remain any more courage in any man  because of you  for the lord your god  he  is  god in heaven above  and in earth beneath   
   now therefore  i pray you  swear unto me by the lord  since i have shewed you kindness  that ye will also shew kindness unto my father s house  and give me a true token   
   and  that  ye will save alive my father  and my mother  and my brethren  and my sisters  and all that they have  and deliver our lives from death   
   and the men answered her  our life for yours  if ye utter not this our business  and it shall be  when the lord hath given us the land  that we will deal kindly and truly with thee   
   then she let them down by a cord through the window  for her house  was  upon the town wall  and she dwelt upon the wall   
   and she said unto them  get you to the mountain  lest the pursuers meet you  and hide yourselves there three days  until the pursuers be returned  and afterward may ye go your way   
   and the men said unto her  we  will be  blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear   
   behold   when  we come into the land  thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by  and thou shalt bring thy father  and thy mother  and thy brethren  and all thy father s household  home unto thee   
   and it shall be   that  whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street  his blood  shall be  upon his head  and we  will be  guiltless  and whosoever shall be with thee in the house  his blood  shall be  on our head  if  any  hand be upon him   
   and if thou utter this our business  then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear   
   and she said  according unto your words  so  be  it  and she sent them away  and they departed  and she bound the scarlet line in the window   
    and they went  and came unto the mountain  and abode there three days  until the pursuers were returned  and the pursuers sought  them  throughout all the way  but found  them  not   
   so the two men returned  and descended from the mountain  and passed over  and came to joshua the son of nun  and told him all  things  that befell them   
   and they said unto joshua  truly the lord hath delivered into our hands all the land  for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us   
joshua   
   and joshua rose early in the morning  and they removed from shittim  and came to jordan  he and all the children of israel  and lodged there before they passed over   
  and it came to pass after three days  that the officers went through the host   
  and they commanded the people  saying  when ye see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god  and the priests the levites bearing it  then ye shall remove from your place  and go after it   
  yet there shall be a space between you and it  about two thousand cubits by measure  come not near unto it  that ye may know the way by which ye must go  for ye have not passed  this  way heretofore   
  and joshua said unto the people  sanctify yourselves  for to morrow the lord will do wonders among you   
  and joshua spake unto the priests  saying  take up the ark of the covenant  and pass over before the people  and they took up the ark of the covenant  and went before the people   
   and the lord said unto joshua  this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel  that they may know that  as i was with moses   so  i will be with thee   
  and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant  saying  when ye are come to the brink of the water of jordan  ye shall stand still in jordan   
  and joshua said unto the children of israel  come hither  and hear the words of the lord your god   
   and joshua said  hereby ye shall know that the living god  is  among you  and  that  he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites  and the hittites  and the hivites  and the perizzites  and the girgashites  and the amorites  and the jebusites   
   behold  the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth over before you into jordan   
   now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israel  out of every tribe a man   
   and it shall come to pass  as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the lord  the lord of all the earth  shall rest in the waters of jordan   that  the waters of jordan shall be cut off  from  the waters that come down from above  and they shall stand upon an heap   
    and it came to pass  when the people removed from their tents  to pass over jordan  and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people   
   and as they that bare the ark were come unto jordan  and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water   for jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest    
   that the waters which came down from above stood  and  rose up upon an heap very far from the city adam  that  is  beside zaretan  and those that came down toward the sea of the plain   even  the salt sea  failed   and  were cut off  and the people passed over right against jericho   
   and the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan  and all the israelites passed over on dry ground  until all the people were passed clean over jordan   
joshua   
   and it came to pass  when all the people were clean passed over jordan  that the lord spake unto joshua  saying   
  take you twelve men out of the people  out of every tribe a man   
  and command ye them  saying  take you hence out of the midst of jordan  out of the place where the priests  feet stood firm  twelve stones  and ye shall carry them over with you  and leave them in the lodging place  where ye shall lodge this night   
  then joshua called the twelve men  whom he had prepared of the children of israel  out of every tribe a man   
  and joshua said unto them  pass over before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of jordan  and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder  according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel   
  that this may be a sign among you   that  when your children ask  their fathers  in time to come  saying  what  mean  ye by these stones   
  then ye shall answer them  that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord  when it passed over jordan  the waters of jordan were cut off  and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of israel for ever   
  and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded  and took up twelve stones out of the midst of jordan  as the lord spake unto joshua  according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel  and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged  and laid them down there   
  and joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of jordan  in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood  and they are there unto this day   
    for the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of jordan  until every thing was finished that the lord commanded joshua to speak unto the people  according to all that moses commanded joshua  and the people hasted and passed over   
   and it came to pass  when all the people were clean passed over  that the ark of the lord passed over  and the priests  in the presence of the people   
   and the children of reuben  and the children of gad  and half the tribe of manasseh  passed over armed before the children of israel  as moses spake unto them   
   about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the lord unto battle  to the plains of jericho   
   on that day the lord magnified joshua in the sight of all israel  and they feared him  as they feared moses  all the days of his life   
   and the lord spake unto joshua  saying   
   command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony  that they come up out of jordan   
   joshua therefore commanded the priests  saying  come ye up out of jordan   
   and it came to pass  when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord were come up out of the midst of jordan   and  the soles of the priests  feet were lifted up unto the dry land  that the waters of jordan returned unto their place  and flowed over all his banks  as  they did  before   
   and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth  day  of the first month  and encamped in gilgal  in the east border of jericho   
    and those twelve stones  which they took out of jordan  did joshua pitch in gilgal   
   and he spake unto the children of israel  saying  when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come  saying  what  mean  these stones   
   then ye shall let your children know  saying  israel came over this jordan on dry land   
   for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you  until ye were passed over  as the lord your god did to the red sea  which he dried up from before us  until we were gone over   
   that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord  that it  is  mighty  that ye might fear the lord your god for ever   
joshua   
   and it came to pass  when all the kings of the amorites  which  were  on the side of jordan westward  and all the kings of the canaanites  which  were  by the sea  heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan from before the children of israel  until we were passed over  that their heart melted  neither was there spirit in them any more  because of the children of israel   
  at that time the lord said unto joshua  make thee sharp knives  and circumcise again the children of israel the second time   
  and joshua made him sharp knives  and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins   
  and this  is  the cause why joshua did circumcise  all the people that came out of egypt   that were  males   even  all the men of war  died in the wilderness by the way  after they came out of egypt   
  now all the people that came out were circumcised  but all the people  that were  born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt   them  they had not circumcised   
  for the children of israel walked forty years in the wilderness  till all the people  that were  men of war  which came out of egypt  were consumed  because they obeyed not the voice of the lord  unto whom the lord sware that he would not shew them the land  which the lord sware unto their fathers that he would give us  a land that floweth with milk and honey   
  and their children   whom  he raised up in their stead  them joshua circumcised  for they were uncircumcised  because they had not circumcised them by the way   
  and it came to pass  when they had done circumcising all the people  that they abode in their places in the camp  till they were whole   
  and the lord said unto joshua  this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you  wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day   
    and the children of israel encamped in gilgal  and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of jericho   
   and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover  unleavened cakes  and parched  corn  in the selfsame day   
   and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land  neither had the children of israel manna any more  but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year   
    and it came to pass  when joshua was by jericho  that he lifted up his eyes and looked  and  behold  there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand  and joshua went unto him  and said unto him   art  thou for us  or for our adversaries   
   and he said  nay  but  as  captain of the host of the lord am i now come  and joshua fell on his face to the earth  and did worship  and said unto him  what saith my lord unto his servant   
   and the captain of the lord s host said unto joshua  loose thy shoe from off thy foot  for the place whereon thou standest  is  holy  and joshua did so   
joshua   
   now jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of israel  none went out  and none came in   
  and the lord said unto joshua  see  i have given into thine hand jericho  and the king thereof   and  the mighty men of valour   
  and ye shall compass the city  all  ye  men of war   and  go round about the city once  thus shalt thou do six days   
  and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams  horns  and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times  and the priests shall blow with the trumpets   
  and it shall come to pass  that when they make a long  blast  with the ram s horn   and  when ye hear the sound of the trumpet  all the people shall shout with a great shout  and the wall of the city shall fall down flat  and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him   
   and joshua the son of nun called the priests  and said unto them  take up the ark of the covenant  and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams  horns before the ark of the lord   
  and he said unto the people  pass on  and compass the city  and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the lord   
  and it came to pass  when joshua had spoken unto the people  that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams  horns passed on before the lord  and blew with the trumpets  and the ark of the covenant of the lord followed them   
  and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets  and the rereward came after the ark   the priests  going on  and blowing with the trumpets   
   and joshua had commanded the people  saying  ye shall not shout  nor make any noise with your voice  neither shall  any  word proceed out of your mouth  until the day i bid you shout  then shall ye shout   
   so the ark of the lord compassed the city  going about  it  once  and they came into the camp  and lodged in the camp   
   and joshua rose early in the morning  and the priests took up the ark of the lord   
   and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams  horns before the ark of the lord went on continually  and blew with the trumpets  and the armed men went before them  but the rereward came after the ark of the lord   the priests  going on  and blowing with the trumpets   
   and the second day they compassed the city once  and returned into the camp  so they did six days   
   and it came to pass on the seventh day  that they rose early about the dawning of the day  and compassed the city after the same manner seven times  only on that day they compassed the city seven times   
   and it came to pass at the seventh time  when the priests blew with the trumpets  joshua said unto the people  shout  for the lord hath given you the city   
    and the city shall be accursed   even  it  and all that  are  therein  to the lord  only rahab the harlot shall live  she and all that  are  with her in the house  because she hid the messengers that we sent   
   and ye  in any wise keep  yourselves  from the accursed thing  lest ye make  yourselves  accursed  when ye take of the accursed thing  and make the camp of israel a curse  and trouble it   
   but all the silver  and gold  and vessels of brass and iron   are  consecrated unto the lord  they shall come into the treasury of the lord   
   so the people shouted when  the priests  blew with the trumpets  and it came to pass  when the people heard the sound of the trumpet  and the people shouted with a great shout  that the wall fell down flat  so that the people went up into the city  every man straight before him  and they took the city   
   and they utterly destroyed all that  was  in the city  both man and woman  young and old  and ox  and sheep  and ass  with the edge of the sword   
   but joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country  go into the harlot s house  and bring out thence the woman  and all that she hath  as ye sware unto her   
   and the young men that were spies went in  and brought out rahab  and her father  and her mother  and her brethren  and all that she had  and they brought out all her kindred  and left them without the camp of israel   
   and they burnt the city with fire  and all that  was  therein  only the silver  and the gold  and the vessels of brass and of iron  they put into the treasury of the house of the lord   
   and joshua saved rahab the harlot alive  and her father s household  and all that she had  and she dwelleth in israel  even  unto this day  because she hid the messengers  which joshua sent to spy out jericho   
   and joshua adjured  them  at that time  saying  cursed  be  the man before the lord  that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho  he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn  and in his youngest  son  shall he set up the gates of it   
   so the lord was with joshua  and his fame was  noised  throughout all the country   
joshua   
   but the children of israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing  for achan  the son of carmi  the son of zabdi  the son of zerah  of the tribe of judah  took of the accursed thing  and the anger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel   
  and joshua sent men from jericho to ai  which  is  beside bethaven  on the east side of bethel  and spake unto them  saying  go up and view the country  and the men went up and viewed ai   
  and they returned to joshua  and said unto him  let not all the people go up  but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite ai   and  make not all the people to labour thither  for they  are but  few   
  so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men  and they fled before the men of ai   
  and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men  for they chased them  from  before the gate  even  unto shebarim  and smote them in the going down  wherefore the hearts of the people melted  and became as water   
   and joshua rent his clothes  and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the lord until the eventide  he and the elders of israel  and put dust upon their heads   
  and joshua said  alas  o lord god  wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over jordan  to deliver us into the hand of the amorites  to destroy us  would to god we had been content  and dwelt on the other side jordan   
  o lord  what shall i say  when israel turneth their backs before their enemies   
  for the canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear  of it   and shall environ us round  and cut off our name from the earth  and what wilt thou do unto thy great name   
    and the lord said unto joshua  get thee up  wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face   
   israel hath sinned  and they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them  for they have even taken of the accursed thing  and have also stolen  and dissembled also  and they have put  it  even among their own stuff   
   therefore the children of israel could not stand before their enemies   but  turned  their  backs before their enemies  because they were accursed  neither will i be with you any more  except ye destroy the accursed from among you   
   up  sanctify the people  and say  sanctify yourselves against to morrow  for thus saith the lord god of israel   there is  an accursed thing in the midst of thee  o israel  thou canst not stand before thine enemies  until ye take away the accursed thing from among you   
   in the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes  and it shall be   that  the tribe which the lord taketh shall come according to the families  thereof   and the family which the lord shall take shall come by households  and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man   
   and it shall be   that  he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire  he and all that he hath  because he hath transgressed the covenant of the lord  and because he hath wrought folly in israel   
    so joshua rose up early in the morning  and brought israel by their tribes  and the tribe of judah was taken   
   and he brought the family of judah  and he took the family of the zarhites  and he brought the family of the zarhites man by man  and zabdi was taken   
   and he brought his household man by man  and achan  the son of carmi  the son of zabdi  the son of zerah  of the tribe of judah  was taken   
   and joshua said unto achan  my son  give  i pray thee  glory to the lord god of israel  and make confession unto him  and tell me now what thou hast done  hide  it  not from me   
   and achan answered joshua  and said  indeed i have sinned against the lord god of israel  and thus and thus have i done   
   when i saw among the spoils a goodly babylonish garment  and two hundred shekels of silver  and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight  then i coveted them  and took them  and  behold  they  are  hid in the earth in the midst of my tent  and the silver under it   
   so joshua sent messengers  and they ran unto the tent  and  behold   it was  hid in his tent  and the silver under it   
   and they took them out of the midst of the tent  and brought them unto joshua  and unto all the children of israel  and laid them out before the lord   
   and joshua  and all israel with him  took achan the son of zerah  and the silver  and the garment  and the wedge of gold  and his sons  and his daughters  and his oxen  and his asses  and his sheep  and his tent  and all that he had  and they brought them unto the valley of achor   
   and joshua said  why hast thou troubled us  the lord shall trouble thee this day  and all israel stoned him with stones  and burned them with fire  after they had stoned them with stones   
   and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day  so the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger  wherefore the name of that place was called  the valley of achor  unto this day   
joshua   
   and the lord said unto joshua  fear not  neither be thou dismayed  take all the people of war with thee  and arise  go up to ai  see  i have given into thy hand the king of ai  and his people  and his city  and his land   
  and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou didst unto jericho and her king  only the spoil thereof  and the cattle thereof  shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves  lay thee an ambush for the city behind it   
   so joshua arose  and all the people of war  to go up against ai  and joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour  and sent them away by night   
  and he commanded them  saying  behold  ye shall lie in wait against the city   even  behind the city  go not very far from the city  but be ye all ready   
  and i  and all the people that  are  with me  will approach unto the city  and it shall come to pass  when they come out against us  as at the first  that we will flee before them   
   for they will come out after us  till we have drawn them from the city  for they will say  they flee before us  as at the first  therefore we will flee before them   
  then ye shall rise up from the ambush  and seize upon the city  for the lord your god will deliver it into your hand   
  and it shall be  when ye have taken the city   that  ye shall set the city on fire  according to the commandment of the lord shall ye do  see  i have commanded you   
  joshua therefore sent them forth  and they went to lie in ambush  and abode between bethel and ai  on the west side of ai  but joshua lodged that night among the people   
   and joshua rose up early in the morning  and numbered the people  and went up  he and the elders of israel  before the people to ai   
   and all the people   even the people  of war that  were  with him  went up  and drew nigh  and came before the city  and pitched on the north side of ai  now  there was  a valley between them and ai   
   and he took about five thousand men  and set them to lie in ambush between bethel and ai  on the west side of the city   
   and when they had set the people   even  all the host that  was  on the north of the city  and their liers in wait on the west of the city  joshua went that night into the midst of the valley   
   and it came to pass  when the king of ai saw  it   that they hasted and rose up early  and the men of the city went out against israel to battle  he and all his people  at a time appointed  before the plain  but he wist not that  there were  liers in ambush against him behind the city   
   and joshua and all israel made as if they were beaten before them  and fled by the way of the wilderness   
   and all the people that  were  in ai were called together to pursue after them  and they pursued after joshua  and were drawn away from the city   
   and there was not a man left in ai or bethel  that went not out after israel  and they left the city open  and pursued after israel   
   and the lord said unto joshua  stretch out the spear that  is  in thy hand toward ai  for i will give it into thine hand  and joshua stretched out the spear that  he had  in his hand toward the city   
   and the ambush arose quickly out of their place  and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand  and they entered into the city  and took it  and hasted and set the city on fire   
   and when the men of ai looked behind them  they saw  and  behold  the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven  and they had no power to flee this way or that way  and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers   
   and when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush had taken the city  and that the smoke of the city ascended  then they turned again  and slew the men of ai   
   and the other issued out of the city against them  so they were in the midst of israel  some on this side  and some on that side  and they smote them  so that they let none of them remain or escape   
    and the king of ai they took alive  and brought him to joshua   
   and it came to pass  when israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of ai in the field  in the wilderness wherein they chased them  and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword  until they were consumed  that all the israelites returned unto ai  and smote it with the edge of the sword   
   and  so  it was   that  all that fell that day  both of men and women   were  twelve thousand   even  all the men of ai   
   for joshua drew not his hand back  wherewith he stretched out the spear  until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai   
   only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for a prey unto themselves  according unto the word of the lord which he commanded joshua   
   and joshua burnt ai  and made it an heap for ever   even  a desolation unto this day   
   and the king of ai he hanged on a tree until eventide  and as soon as the sun was down  joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree  and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city  and raise thereon a great heap of stones   that remaineth  unto this day   
    then joshua built an altar unto the lord god of israel in mount ebal   
   as moses the servant of the lord commanded the children of israel  as it is written in the book of the law of moses  an altar of whole stones  over which no man hath lift up  any  iron  and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the lord  and sacrificed peace offerings   
   and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moses  which he wrote in the presence of the children of israel   
   and all israel  and their elders  and officers  and their judges  stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the levites  which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord  as well the stranger  as he that was born among them  half of them over against mount gerizim  and half of them over against mount ebal  as moses the servant of the lord had commanded before  that they should bless the people of israel   
   and afterward he read all the words of the law  the blessings and cursings  according to all that is written in the book of the law   
   there was not a word of all that moses commanded  which joshua read not before all the congregation of israel  with the women  and the little ones  and the strangers that were conversant among them   
joshua   
   and it came to pass  when all the kings which  were  on this side jordan  in the hills  and in the valleys  and in all the coasts of the great sea over against lebanon  the hittite  and the amorite  the canaanite  the perizzite  the hivite  and the jebusite  heard  thereof    
  that they gathered themselves together  to fight with joshua and with israel  with one accord   
   and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done unto jericho and to ai   
  they did work wilily  and went and made as if they had been ambassadors  and took old sacks upon their asses  and wine bottles  old  and rent  and bound up   
  and old shoes and clouted upon their feet  and old garments upon them  and all the bread of their provision was dry  and  mouldy   
  and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal  and said unto him  and to the men of israel  we be come from a far country  now therefore make ye a league with us   
  and the men of israel said unto the hivites  peradventure ye dwell among us  and how shall we make a league with you   
  and they said unto joshua  we  are  thy servants  and joshua said unto them  who  are  ye  and from whence come ye   
  and they said unto him  from a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thy god  for we have heard the fame of him  and all that he did in egypt   
   and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites  that  were  beyond jordan  to sihon king of heshbon  and to og king of bashan  which  was  at ashtaroth   
   wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us  saying  take victuals with you for the journey  and go to meet them  and say unto them  we  are  your servants  therefore now make ye a league with us   
   this our bread we took hot  for  our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you  but now  behold  it is dry  and it is mouldy   
   and these bottles of wine  which we filled   were  new  and  behold  they be rent  and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey   
   and the men took of their victuals  and asked not  counsel  at the mouth of the lord   
    and joshua made peace with them  and made a league with them  to let them live  and the princes of the congregation sware unto them   
   and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them  that they heard that they  were  their neighbours  and  that  they dwelt among them   
   and the children of israel journeyed  and came unto their cities on the third day  now their cities  were  gibeon  and chephirah  and beeroth  and kirjathjearim   
   and the children of israel smote them not  because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the lord god of israel  and all the congregation murmured against the princes   
   but all the princes said unto all the congregation  we have sworn unto them by the lord god of israel  now therefore we may not touch them   
   this we will do to them  we will even let them live  lest wrath be upon us  because of the oath which we sware unto them   
   and the princes said unto them  let them live  but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation  as the princes had promised them   
    and joshua called for them  and he spake unto them  saying  wherefore have ye beguiled us  saying  we  are  very far from you  when ye dwell among us   
   now therefore ye  are  cursed  and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen  and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my god   
   and they answered joshua  and said  because it was certainly told thy servants  how that the lord thy god commanded his servant moses to give you all the land  and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you  therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you  and have done this thing   
   and now  behold  we  are  in thine hand  as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us  do   
   and so did he unto them  and delivered them out of the hand of the children of israel  that they slew them not   
   and joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation  and for the altar of the lord  even unto this day  in the place which he should choose   
joshua    
   now it came to pass  when adonizedek king of jerusalem had heard how joshua had taken ai  and had utterly destroyed it  as he had done to jericho and her king  so he had done to ai and her king  and how the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with israel  and were among them   
  that they feared greatly  because gibeon  was  a great city  as one of the royal cities  and because it  was  greater than ai  and all the men thereof  were  mighty   
  wherefore adonizedek king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of hebron  and unto piram king of jarmuth  and unto japhia king of lachish  and unto debir king of eglon  saying   
  come up unto me  and help me  that we may smite gibeon  for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel   
  therefore the five kings of the amorites  the king of jerusalem  the king of hebron  the king of jarmuth  the king of lachish  the king of eglon  gathered themselves together  and went up  they and all their hosts  and encamped before gibeon  and made war against it   
  and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal  saying  slack not thy hand from thy servants  come up to us quickly  and save us  and help us  for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us   
   so joshua ascended from gilgal  he  and all the people of war with him  and all the mighty men of valour   
  and the lord said unto joshua  fear them not  for i have delivered them into thine hand  there shall not a man of them stand before thee   
  joshua therefore came unto them suddenly   and  went up from gilgal all night   
   and the lord discomfited them before israel  and slew them with a great slaughter at gibeon  and chased them along the way that goeth up to bethhoron  and smote them to azekah  and unto makkedah   
   and it came to pass  as they fled from before israel   and  were in the going down to bethhoron  that the lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto azekah  and they died   they were  more which died with hailstones than  they  whom the children of israel slew with the sword   
   then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel  and he said in the sight of israel  sun  stand thou still upon gibeon  and thou  moon  in the valley of ajalon   
   and the sun stood still  and the moon stayed  until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies   is  not this written in the book of jasher  so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven  and hasted not to go down about a whole day   
   and there was no day like that before it or after it  that the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man  for the lord fought for israel   
    and joshua returned  and all israel with him  unto the camp to gilgal   
   but these five kings fled  and hid themselves in a cave at makkedah   
   and it was told joshua  saying  the five kings are found hid in a cave at makkedah   
   and joshua said  roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave  and set men by it for to keep them   
   and stay ye not   but  pursue after your enemies  and smite the hindmost of them  suffer them not to enter into their cities  for the lord your god hath delivered them into your hand   
   and it came to pass  when joshua and the children of israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter  till they were consumed  that the rest  which  remained of them entered into fenced cities   
   and all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makkedah in peace  none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel   
   then said joshua  open the mouth of the cave  and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave   
   and they did so  and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave  the king of jerusalem  the king of hebron  the king of jarmuth  the king of lachish   and  the king of eglon   
   and it came to pass  when they brought out those kings unto joshua  that joshua called for all the men of israel  and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him  come near  put your feet upon the necks of these kings  and they came near  and put their feet upon the necks of them   
   and joshua said unto them  fear not  nor be dismayed  be strong and of good courage  for thus shall the lord do to all your enemies against whom ye fight   
   and afterward joshua smote them  and slew them  and hanged them on five trees  and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening   
   and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun   that  joshua commanded  and they took them down off the trees  and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid  and laid great stones in the cave s mouth   which remain  until this very day   
    and that day joshua took makkedah  and smote it with the edge of the sword  and the king thereof he utterly destroyed  them  and all the souls that  were  therein  he let none remain  and he did to the king of makkedah as he did unto the king of jericho   
   then joshua passed from makkedah  and all israel with him  unto libnah  and fought against libnah   
   and the lord delivered it also  and the king thereof  into the hand of israel  and he smote it with the edge of the sword  and all the souls that  were  therein  he let none remain in it  but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of jericho   
   and joshua passed from libnah  and all israel with him  unto lachish  and encamped against it  and fought against it   
   and the lord delivered lachish into the hand of israel  which took it on the second day  and smote it with the edge of the sword  and all the souls that  were  therein  according to all that he had done to libnah   
   then horam king of gezer came up to help lachish  and joshua smote him and his people  until he had left him none remaining   
   and from lachish joshua passed unto eglon  and all israel with him  and they encamped against it  and fought against it   
   and they took it on that day  and smote it with the edge of the sword  and all the souls that  were  therein he utterly destroyed that day  according to all that he had done to lachish   
   and joshua went up from eglon  and all israel with him  unto hebron  and they fought against it   
   and they took it  and smote it with the edge of the sword  and the king thereof  and all the cities thereof  and all the souls that  were  therein  he left none remaining  according to all that he had done to eglon  but destroyed it utterly  and all the souls that  were  therein   
   and joshua returned  and all israel with him  to debir  and fought against it   
   and he took it  and the king thereof  and all the cities thereof  and they smote them with the edge of the sword  and utterly destroyed all the souls that  were  therein  he left none remaining  as he had done to hebron  so he did to debir  and to the king thereof  as he had done also to libnah  and to her king   
   so joshua smote all the country of the hills  and of the south  and of the vale  and of the springs  and all their kings  he left none remaining  but utterly destroyed all that breathed  as the lord god of israel commanded   
   and joshua smote them from kadeshbarnea even unto gaza  and all the country of goshen  even unto gibeon   
   and all these kings and their land did joshua take at one time  because the lord god of israel fought for israel   
   and joshua returned  and all israel with him  unto the camp to gilgal   
joshua    
   and it came to pass  when jabin king of hazor had heard  those things   that he sent to jobab king of madon  and to the king of shimron  and to the king of achshaph   
  and to the kings that  were  on the north of the mountains  and of the plains south of chinneroth  and in the valley  and in the borders of dor on the west   
   and to  the canaanite on the east and on the west  and  to  the amorite  and the hittite  and the perizzite  and the jebusite in the mountains  and  to  the hivite under hermon in the land of mizpeh   
  and they went out  they and all their hosts with them  much people  even as the sand that  is  upon the sea shore in multitude  with horses and chariots very many   
  and when all these kings were met together  they came and pitched together at the waters of merom  to fight against israel   
  and the lord said unto joshua  be not afraid because of them  for to morrow about this time will i deliver them up all slain before israel  thou shalt hough their horses  and burn their chariots with fire   
  so joshua came  and all the people of war with him  against them by the waters of merom suddenly  and they fell upon them   
  and the lord delivered them into the hand of israel  who smote them  and chased them unto great zidon  and unto misrephothmaim  and unto the valley of mizpeh eastward  and they smote them  until they left them none remaining   
  and joshua did unto them as the lord bade him  he houghed their horses  and burnt their chariots with fire   
    and joshua at that time turned back  and took hazor  and smote the king thereof with the sword  for hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms   
   and they smote all the souls that  were  therein with the edge of the sword  utterly destroying  them   there was not any left to breathe  and he burnt hazor with fire   
   and all the cities of those kings  and all the kings of them  did joshua take  and smote them with the edge of the sword   and  he utterly destroyed them  as moses the servant of the lord commanded   
   but  as for  the cities that stood still in their strength  israel burned none of them  save hazor only   that  did joshua burn   
   and all the spoil of these cities  and the cattle  the children of israel took for a prey unto themselves  but every man they smote with the edge of the sword  until they had destroyed them  neither left they any to breathe   
    as the lord commanded moses his servant  so did moses command joshua  and so did joshua  he left nothing undone of all that the lord commanded moses   
   so joshua took all that land  the hills  and all the south country  and all the land of goshen  and the valley  and the plain  and the mountain of israel  and the valley of the same   
    even  from the mount halak  that goeth up to seir  even unto baalgad in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon  and all their kings he took  and smote them  and slew them   
   joshua made war a long time with all those kings   
   there was not a city that made peace with the children of israel  save the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon  all  other  they took in battle   
   for it was of the lord to harden their hearts  that they should come against israel in battle  that he might destroy them utterly   and  that they might have no favour  but that he might destroy them  as the lord commanded moses   
   and at that time came joshua  and cut off the anakims from the mountains  from hebron  from debir  from anab  and from all the mountains of judah  and from all the mountains of israel  joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities   
   there was none of the anakims left in the land of the children of israel  only in gaza  in gath  and in ashdod  there remained   
   so joshua took the whole land  according to all that the lord said unto moses  and joshua gave it for an inheritance unto israel according to their divisions by their tribes  and the land rested from war   
joshua    
   now these  are  the kings of the land  which the children of israel smote  and possessed their land on the other side jordan toward the rising of the sun  from the river arnon unto mount hermon  and all the plain on the east   
  sihon king of the amorites  who dwelt in heshbon   and  ruled from aroer  which  is  upon the bank of the river arnon  and from the middle of the river  and from half gilead  even unto the river jabbok   which is  the border of the children of ammon   
  and from the plain to the sea of chinneroth on the east  and unto the sea of the plain   even  the salt sea on the east  the way to bethjeshimoth  and from the south  under ashdothpisgah   
  and the coast of og king of bashan   which was  of the remnant of the giants  that dwelt at ashtaroth and at edrei   
  and reigned in mount hermon  and in salcah  and in all bashan  unto the border of the geshurites and the maachathites  and half gilead  the border of sihon king of heshbon   
  them did moses the servant of the lord and the children of israel smite  and moses the servant of the lord gave it  for  a possession unto the reubenites  and the gadites  and the half tribe of manasseh   
   and these  are  the kings of the country which joshua and the children of israel smote on this side jordan on the west  from baalgad in the valley of lebanon even unto the mount halak  that goeth up to seir  which joshua gave unto the tribes of israel  for  a possession according to their divisions   
  in the mountains  and in the valleys  and in the plains  and in the springs  and in the wilderness  and in the south country  the hittites  the amorites  and the canaanites  the perizzites  the hivites  and the jebusites   
  the king of jericho  one  the king of ai  which  is  beside bethel  one   
   the king of jerusalem  one  the king of hebron  one   
   the king of jarmuth  one  the king of lachish  one

   the king of tirzah  one  all the kings thirty and one   
joshua    
   now joshua was old  and  stricken in years  and the lord said unto him  thou art old  and  stricken in years  and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed   
  this  is  the land that yet remaineth  all the borders of the philistines  and all geshuri   
  from sihor  which  is  before egypt  even unto the borders of ekron northward   which  is counted to the canaanite  five lords of the philistines  the gazathites  and the ashdothites  the eshkalonites  the gittites  and the ekronites  also the avites   
  from the south  all the land of the canaanites  and mearah that  is  beside the sidonians  unto aphek  to the borders of the amorites   
  and the land of the giblites  and all lebanon  toward the sunrising  from baalgad under mount hermon unto the entering into hamath   
  all the inhabitants of the hill country from lebanon unto misrephothmaim   and  all the sidonians  them will i drive out from before the children of israel  only divide thou it by lot unto the israelites for an inheritance  as i have commanded thee   
   now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes  and the half tribe of manasseh   
  with whom the reubenites and the gadites have received their inheritance  which moses gave them  beyond jordan eastward   even  as moses the servant of the lord gave them   
  from aroer  that  is  upon the bank of the river arnon  and the city that  is  in the midst of the river  and all the plain of medeba unto dibon   
   and all the cities of sihon king of the amorites  which reigned in heshbon  unto the border of the children of ammon   
   and gilead  and the border of the geshurites and maachathites  and all mount hermon  and all bashan unto salcah   
   all the kingdom of og in bashan  which reigned in ashtaroth and in edrei  who remained of the remnant of the giants  for these did moses smite  and cast them out   
   nevertheless the children of israel expelled not the geshurites  nor the maachathites  but the geshurites and the maachathites dwell among the israelites until this day   
   only unto the tribe of levi he gave none inheritance  the sacrifices of the lord god of israel made by fire  are  their inheritance  as he said unto them   
   and moses gave unto the tribe of the children of reuben  inheritance  according to their families   
   and their coast was from aroer  that  is  on the bank of the river arnon  and the city that  is  in the midst of the river  and all the plain by medeba   
   heshbon  and all her cities that  are  in the plain  dibon  and bamothbaal  and bethbaalmeon   
   and jahazah  and kedemoth  and mephaath   
   and kirjathaim  and sibmah  and zarethshahar in the mount of the valley   
   and bethpeor  and ashdothpisgah  and bethjeshimoth   
   and all the cities of the plain  and all the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites  which reigned in heshbon  whom moses smote with the princes of midian  evi  and rekem  and zur  and hur  and reba   which were  dukes of sihon  dwelling in the country   
   balaam also the son of beor  the soothsayer  did the children of israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them   
   and the border of the children of reuben was jordan  and the border  thereof   this  was  the inheritance of the children of reuben after their families  the cities and the villages thereof   
   and moses gave  inheritance  unto the tribe of gad   even  unto the children of gad according to their families   
   and their coast was jazer  and all the cities of gilead  and half the land of the children of ammon  unto aroer that  is  before rabbah   
   and from heshbon unto ramathmizpeh  and betonim  and from mahanaim unto the border of debir   
   and in the valley  betharam  and bethnimrah  and succoth  and zaphon  the rest of the kingdom of sihon king of heshbon  jordan and  his  border   even  unto the edge of the sea of chinnereth on the other side jordan eastward   
   this  is  the inheritance of the children of gad after their families  the cities  and their villages   
   and moses gave  inheritance  unto the half tribe of manasseh  and  this  was  the possession  of the half tribe of the children of manasseh by their families   
   and their coast was from mahanaim  all bashan  all the kingdom of og king of bashan  and all the towns of jair  which  are  in bashan  threescore cities   
   and half gilead  and ashtaroth  and edrei  cities of the kingdom of og in bashan   were pertaining  unto the children of machir the son of manasseh   even  to the one half of the children of machir by their families   
   these  are the countries  which moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of moab  on the other side jordan  by jericho  eastward   
   but unto the tribe of levi moses gave not  any  inheritance  the lord god of israel  was  their inheritance  as he said unto them   
joshua    
   and these  are the countries  which the children of israel inherited in the land of canaan  which eleazar the priest  and joshua the son of nun  and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel  distributed for inheritance to them   
  by lot  was  their inheritance  as the lord commanded by the hand of moses  for the nine tribes  and  for  the half tribe   
  for moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side jordan  but unto the levites he gave none inheritance among them   
  for the children of joseph were two tribes  manasseh and ephraim  therefore they gave no part unto the levites in the land  save cities to dwell  in   with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance   
  as the lord commanded moses  so the children of israel did  and they divided the land   
   then the children of judah came unto joshua in gilgal  and caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite said unto him  thou knowest the thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and thee in kadeshbarnea   
  forty years old  was  i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadeshbarnea to espy out the land  and i brought him word again as  it was  in mine heart   
  nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt  but i wholly followed the lord my god   
  and moses sware on that day  saying  surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance  and thy children s for ever  because thou hast wholly followed the lord my god   
   and now  behold  the lord hath kept me alive  as he said  these forty and five years  even since the lord spake this word unto moses  while  the children of  israel wandered in the wilderness  and now  lo  i  am  this day fourscore and five years old   
   as yet i  am as  strong this day as  i was  in the day that moses sent me  as my strength  was  then  even so  is  my strength now  for war  both to go out  and to come in   
   now therefore give me this mountain  whereof the lord spake in that day  for thou heardest in that day how the anakims  were  there  and  that  the cities  were  great  and  fenced  if so be the lord  will be  with me  then i shall be able to drive them out  as the lord said   
   and joshua blessed him  and gave unto caleb the son of jephunneh hebron for an inheritance   
   hebron therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite unto this day  because that he wholly followed the lord god of israel   
   and the name of hebron before  was  kirjatharba   which arba was  a great man among the anakims  and the land had rest from war   
joshua    
    this  then was the lot of the tribe of the children of judah by their families   even  to the border of edom the wilderness of zin southward  was  the uttermost part of the south coast   
  and their south border was from the shore of the salt sea  from the bay that looketh southward   
  and it went out to the south side to maalehacrabbim  and passed along to zin  and ascended up on the south side unto kadeshbarnea  and passed along to hezron  and went up to adar  and fetched a compass to karkaa   
   from thence  it passed toward azmon  and went out unto the river of egypt  and the goings out of that coast were at the sea  this shall be your south coast   
  and the east border  was  the salt sea   even  unto the end of jordan  and  their  border in the north quarter  was  from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of jordan   
  and the border went up to bethhogla  and passed along by the north of betharabah  and the border went up to the stone of bohan the son of reuben   
  and the border went up toward debir from the valley of achor  and so northward  looking toward gilgal  that  is  before the going up to adummim  which  is  on the south side of the river  and the border passed toward the waters of enshemesh  and the goings out thereof were at enrogel

  and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of nephtoah  and went out to the cities of mount ephron  and the border was drawn to baalah  which  is  kirjathjearim

   and the border went out unto the side of ekron northward  and the border was drawn to shicron  and passed along to mount baalah  and went out unto jabneel  and the goings out of the border were at the sea   
   and the west border  was  to the great sea  and the coast  thereof   this  is  the coast of the children of judah round about according to their families   
    and unto caleb the son of jephunneh he gave a part among the children of judah  according to the commandment of the lord to joshua   even  the city of arba the father of anak  which  city is  hebron   
   and caleb drove thence the three sons of anak  sheshai  and ahiman  and talmai  the children of anak   
   and he went up thence to the inhabitants of debir  and the name of debir before  was  kirjathsepher   
   and caleb said  he that smiteth kirjathsepher  and taketh it  to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife   
   and othniel the son of kenaz  the brother of caleb  took it  and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife   
   and it came to pass  as she came  unto him   that she moved him to ask of her father a field  and she lighted off  her  ass  and caleb said unto her  what wouldest thou   
   who answered  give me a blessing  for thou hast given me a south land  give me also springs of water  and he gave her the upper springs  and the nether springs

joshua    
   and the lot of the children of joseph fell from jordan by jericho  unto the water of jericho on the east  to the wilderness that goeth up from jericho throughout mount bethel   
  and goeth out from bethel to luz  and passeth along unto the borders of archi to ataroth   
  and goeth down westward to the coast of japhleti  unto the coast of bethhoron the nether  and to gezer  and the goings out thereof are at the sea   
  so the children of joseph  manasseh and ephraim  took their inheritance   
   and the border of the children of ephraim according to their families was  thus   even the border of their inheritance on the east side was atarothaddar  unto bethhoron the upper   
  and the border went out toward the sea to michmethah on the north side  and the border went about eastward unto taanathshiloh  and passed by it on the east to janohah   
  and it went down from janohah to ataroth  and to naarath  and came to jericho  and went out at jordan   
  the border went out from tappuah westward unto the river kanah  and the goings out thereof were at the sea  this  is  the inheritance of the tribe of the children of ephraim by their families   
  and the separate cities for the children of ephraim  were  among the inheritance of the children of manasseh  all the cities with their villages   
   and they drave not out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer  but the canaanites dwell among the ephraimites unto this day  and serve under tribute   
joshua    
   there was also a lot for the tribe of manasseh  for he  was  the firstborn of joseph   to wit   for machir the firstborn of manasseh  the father of gilead  because he was a man of war  therefore he had gilead and bashan   
  there was also  a lot  for the rest of the children of manasseh by their families  for the children of abiezer  and for the children of helek  and for the children of asriel  and for the children of shechem  and for the children of hepher  and for the children of shemida  these  were  the male children of manasseh the son of joseph by their families   
  but zelophehad  the son of hepher  the son of gilead  the son of machir  the son of manasseh  had no sons  but daughters  and these  are  the names of his daughters  mahlah  and noah  hoglah  milcah  and tirzah   
  and they came near before eleazar the priest  and before joshua the son of nun  and before the princes  saying  the lord commanded moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren  therefore according to the commandment of the lord he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father   
  and there fell ten portions to manasseh  beside the land of gilead and bashan  which  were  on the other side jordan   
  because the daughters of manasseh had an inheritance among his sons  and the rest of manasseh s sons had the land of gilead   
   and the coast of manasseh was from asher to michmethah  that  lieth  before shechem  and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of entappuah   
   now  manasseh had the land of tappuah  but tappuah on the border of manasseh  belonged  to the children of ephraim   
  and the coast descended unto the river kanah  southward of the river  these cities of ephraim  are  among the cities of manasseh  the coast of manasseh also  was  on the north side of the river  and the outgoings of it were at the sea   
   southward  it was  ephraim s  and northward  it was  manasseh s  and the sea is his border  and they met together in asher on the north  and in issachar on the east   
   and manasseh had in issachar and in asher bethshean and her towns  and ibleam and her towns  and the inhabitants of dor and her towns  and the inhabitants of endor and her towns  and the inhabitants of taanach and her towns  and the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns   even  three countries   
   yet the children of manasseh could not drive out  the inhabitants of  those cities  but the canaanites would dwell in that land   
   yet it came to pass  when the children of israel were waxen strong  that they put the canaanites to tribute  but did not utterly drive them out   
    and the children of joseph spake unto joshua  saying  why hast thou given me  but  one lot and one portion to inherit  seeing i  am  a great people  forasmuch as the lord hath blessed me hitherto   
   and joshua answered them  if thou  be  a great people   then  get thee up to the wood  country   and cut down for thyself there in the land of the perizzites and of the giants  if mount ephraim be too narrow for thee   
   and the children of joseph said  the hill is not enough for us  and all the canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron   both they  who  are  of bethshean and her towns  and  they  who  are  of the valley of jezreel   
   and joshua spake unto the house of joseph   even  to ephraim and to manasseh  saying  thou  art  a great people  and hast great power  thou shalt not have one lot  only    
   but the mountain shall be thine  for it  is  a wood  and thou shalt cut it down  and the outgoings of it shall be thine  for thou shalt drive out the canaanites  though they have iron chariots   and  though they  be  strong   
joshua    
   and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled together at shiloh  and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there  and the land was subdued before them   
   and there remained among the children of israel seven tribes  which had not yet received their inheritance   
  and joshua said unto the children of israel  how long  are  ye slack to go to possess the land  which the lord god of your fathers hath given you   
  give out from among you three men for  each  tribe  and i will send them  and they shall rise  and go through the land  and describe it according to the inheritance of them  and they shall come  again  to me   
  and they shall divide it into seven parts  judah shall abide in their coast on the south  and the house of joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north   
  ye shall therefore describe the land  into  seven parts  and bring  the description  hither to me  that i may cast lots for you here before the lord our god   
  but the levites have no part among you  for the priesthood of the lord  is  their inheritance  and gad  and reuben  and half the tribe of manasseh  have received their inheritance beyond jordan on the east  which moses the servant of the lord gave them   
  and the men arose  and went away  and joshua charged them that went to describe the land  saying  go and walk through the land  and describe it  and come again to me  that i may here cast lots for you before the lord in shiloh   
  and the men went and passed through the land  and described it by cities into seven parts in a book  and came  again  to joshua to the host at shiloh   
   and joshua cast lots for them in shiloh before the lord  and there joshua divided the land unto the children of israel according to their divisions   
    and the lot of the tribe of the children of benjamin came up according to their families  and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of judah and the children of joseph   
   and their border on the north side was from jordan  and the border went up to the side of jericho on the north side  and went up through the mountains westward  and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of bethaven   
   and the border went over from thence toward luz  to the side of luz  which  is  bethel  southward  and the border descended to atarothadar  near the hill that  lieth  on the south side of the nether bethhoron   
   and the border was drawn  thence   and compassed the corner of the sea southward  from the hill that  lieth  before bethhoron southward  and the goings out thereof were at kirjathbaal  which  is  kirjathjearim  a city of the children of judah  this  was  the west quarter   
   and the south quarter  was  from the end of kirjathjearim  and the border went out on the west  and went out to the well of waters of nephtoah   
   and the border came down to the end of the mountain that  lieth  before the valley of the son of hinnom   and  which  is  in the valley of the giants on the north  and descended to the valley of hinnom  to the side of jebusi on the south  and descended to enrogel   
   and was drawn from the north  and went forth to enshemesh  and went forth toward geliloth  which  is  over against the going up of adummim  and descended to the stone of bohan the son of reuben   
   and passed along toward the side over against arabah northward  and went down unto arabah   
   and the border passed along to the side of bethhoglah northward  and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of jordan  this  was  the south coast   
   and jordan was the border of it on the east side  this  was  the inheritance of the children of benjamin  by the coasts thereof round about  according to their families

  out of the portion of the children of judah  was  the inheritance of the children of simeon  for the part of the children of judah was too much for them  therefore the children of simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them

   this  is  the inheritance of the tribe of the children of dan according to their families  these cities with their villages   
    when they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts  the children of israel gave an inheritance to joshua the son of nun among them   
   according to the word of the lord they gave him the city which he asked   even  timnathserah in mount ephraim  and he built the city  and dwelt therein   
   these  are  the inheritances  which eleazar the priest  and joshua the son of nun  and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel  divided for an inheritance by lot in shiloh before the lord  at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  so they made an end of dividing the country   
joshua    
   the lord also spake unto joshua  saying   
  speak to the children of israel  saying  appoint out for you cities of refuge  whereof i spake unto you by the hand of moses   
  that the slayer that killeth  any  person unawares  and  unwittingly may flee thither  and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood   
  and when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city  and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city  they shall take him into the city unto them  and give him a place  that he may dwell among them   
  and if the avenger of blood pursue after him  then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand  because he smote his neighbour unwittingly  and hated him not beforetime   
  and he shall dwell in that city  until he stand before the congregation for judgment   and  until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days  then shall the slayer return  and come unto his own city  and unto his own house  unto the city from whence he fled   
   and they appointed kedesh in galilee in mount naphtali  and shechem in mount ephraim  and kirjatharba  which  is  hebron  in the mountain of judah   
  and on the other side jordan by jericho eastward  they assigned bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of reuben  and ramoth in gilead out of the tribe of gad  and golan in bashan out of the tribe of manasseh   
  these were the cities appointed for all the children of israel  and for the stranger that sojourneth among them  that whosoever killeth  any  person at unawares might flee thither  and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood  until he stood before the congregation   
joshua    
   then came near the heads of the fathers of the levites unto eleazar the priest  and unto joshua the son of nun  and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel   
  and they spake unto them at shiloh in the land of canaan  saying  the lord commanded by the hand of moses to give us cities to dwell in  with the suburbs thereof for our cattle   
  and the children of israel gave unto the levites out of their inheritance  at the commandment of the lord  these cities and their suburbs   
  and the lot came out for the families of the kohathites  and the children of aaron the priest   which were  of the levites  had by lot out of the tribe of judah  and out of the tribe of simeon  and out of the tribe of benjamin  thirteen cities

  the children of merari by their families  had  out of the tribe of reuben  and out of the tribe of gad  and out of the tribe of zebulun  twelve cities   
  and the children of israel gave by lot unto the levites these cities with their suburbs  as the lord commanded by the hand of moses   
   and they gave out of the tribe of the children of judah  and out of the tribe of the children of simeon  these cities which are  here  mentioned by name   
   which the children of aaron   being  of the families of the kohathites   who were  of the children of levi  had  for theirs was the first lot   
   and they gave them the city of arba the father of anak  which  city is  hebron  in the hill  country  of judah  with the suburbs thereof round about it   
   but the fields of the city  and the villages thereof  gave they to caleb the son of jephunneh for his possession   
   thus they gave to the children of aaron the priest hebron with her suburbs   to be  a city of refuge for the slayer  and libnah with her suburbs   
   and jattir with her suburbs  and eshtemoa with her suburbs   
   and holon with her suburbs  and debir with her suburbs

   anathoth with her suburbs  and almon with her suburbs  four cities   
   all the cities of the children of aaron  the priests   were  thirteen cities with their suburbs   
   and the families of the children of kohath  the levites which remained of the children of kohath  even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of ephraim   
   for they gave them shechem with her suburbs in mount ephraim   to be  a city of refuge for the slayer  and gezer with her suburbs   
   and kibzaim with her suburbs  and bethhoron with her suburbs  four cities   
   and out of the tribe of dan  eltekeh with her suburbs  gibbethon with her suburbs   
   aijalon with her suburbs  gathrimmon with her suburbs  four cities   
   and out of the half tribe of manasseh  tanach with her suburbs  and gathrimmon with her suburbs  two cities   
   all the cities  were  ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of kohath that remained   
   and unto the children of gershon  of the families of the levites  out of the  other  half tribe of manasseh  they gave  golan in bashan with her suburbs   to be  a city of refuge for the slayer  and beeshterah with her suburbs  two cities   
   and out of the tribe of issachar  kishon with her suburbs  dabareh with her suburbs   
   jarmuth with her suburbs  engannim with her suburbs  four cities   
   and out of the tribe of asher  mishal with her suburbs  abdon with her suburbs   
   helkath with her suburbs  and rehob with her suburbs  four cities   
   and out of the tribe of naphtali  kedesh in galilee with her suburbs   to be  a city of refuge for the slayer  and hammothdor with her suburbs  and kartan with her suburbs  three cities   
   all the cities of the gershonites according to their families  were  thirteen cities with their suburbs   
   and unto the families of the children of merari  the rest of the levites  out of the tribe of zebulun  jokneam with her suburbs  and kartah with her suburbs   
   dimnah with her suburbs  nahalal with her suburbs  four cities   
   and out of the tribe of reuben  bezer with her suburbs  and jahazah with her suburbs   
   kedemoth with her suburbs  and mephaath with her suburbs  four cities   
   and out of the tribe of gad  ramoth in gilead with her suburbs   to be  a city of refuge for the slayer  and mahanaim with her suburbs   
   heshbon with her suburbs  jazer with her suburbs  four cities in all   
   so all the cities for the children of merari by their families  which were remaining of the families of the levites  were  by  their lot twelve cities   
   all the cities of the levites within the possession of the children of israel  were  forty and eight cities with their suburbs   
   these cities were every one with their suburbs round about them  thus  were  all these cities   
    and the lord gave unto israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers  and they possessed it  and dwelt therein   
   and the lord gave them rest round about  according to all that he sware unto their fathers  and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them  the lord delivered all their enemies into their hand   
   there failed not ought of any good thing which the lord had spoken unto the house of israel  all came to pass   
joshua    
   then joshua called the reubenites  and the gadites  and the half tribe of manasseh   
  and said unto them  ye have kept all that moses the servant of the lord commanded you  and have obeyed my voice in all that i commanded you   
  ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day  but have kept the charge of the commandment of the lord your god   
  and now the lord your god hath given rest unto your brethren  as he promised them  therefore now return ye  and get you unto your tents   and  unto the land of your possession  which moses the servant of the lord gave you on the other side jordan   
  but take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law  which moses the servant of the lord charged you  to love the lord your god  and to walk in all his ways  and to keep his commandments  and to cleave unto him  and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul   
  so joshua blessed them  and sent them away  and they went unto their tents   
  now to the  one  half of the tribe of manasseh moses had given  possession  in bashan  but unto the  other  half thereof gave joshua among their brethren on this side jordan westward  and when joshua sent them away also unto their tents  then he blessed them   
  and he spake unto them  saying  return with much riches unto your tents  and with very much cattle  with silver  and with gold  and with brass  and with iron  and with very much raiment  divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren   
  and the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh returned  and departed from the children of israel out of shiloh  which  is  in the land of canaan  to go unto the country of gilead  to the land of their possession  whereof they were possessed  according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses   
    and when they came unto the borders of jordan  that  are  in the land of canaan  the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh built there an altar by jordan  a great altar to see to   
   and the children of israel heard say  behold  the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh have built an altar over against the land of canaan  in the borders of jordan  at the passage of the children of israel   
   and when the children of israel heard  of it   the whole congregation of the children of israel gathered themselves together at shiloh  to go up to war against them   
   and the children of israel sent unto the children of reuben  and to the children of gad  and to the half tribe of manasseh  into the land of gilead  phinehas the son of eleazar the priest   
   and with him ten princes  of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of israel  and each one  was  an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of israel   
   and they came unto the children of reuben  and to the children of gad  and to the half tribe of manasseh  unto the land of gilead  and they spake with them  saying   
   thus saith the whole congregation of the lord  what trespass  is  this that ye have committed against the god of israel  to turn away this day from following the lord  in that ye have builded you an altar  that ye might rebel this day against the lord   
    is  the iniquity of peor too little for us  from which we are not cleansed until this day  although there was a plague in the congregation of the lord   
   but that ye must turn away this day from following the lord  and it will be   seeing  ye rebel to day against the lord  that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of israel   
   notwithstanding  if the land of your possession  be  unclean   then  pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the lord  wherein the lord s tabernacle dwelleth  and take possession among us  but rebel not against the lord  nor rebel against us  in building you an altar beside the altar of the lord our god   
   did not achan the son of zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing  and wrath fell on all the congregation of israel  and that man perished not alone in his iniquity   
    then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh answered  and said unto the heads of the thousands of israel   
   the lord god of gods  the lord god of gods  he knoweth  and israel he shall know  if  it be  in rebellion  or if in transgression against the lord   save us not this day    
   that we have built us an altar to turn from following the lord  or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering  or if to offer peace offerings thereon  let the lord himself require  it    
   and if we have not  rather  done it for fear of  this  thing  saying  in time to come your children might speak unto our children  saying  what have ye to do with the lord god of israel   
   for the lord hath made jordan a border between us and you  ye children of reuben and children of gad  ye have no part in the lord  so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the lord   
   therefore we said  let us now prepare to build us an altar  not for burnt offering  nor for sacrifice   
   but  that  it  may be  a witness between us  and you  and our generations after us  that we might do the service of the lord before him with our burnt offerings  and with our sacrifices  and with our peace offerings  that your children may not say to our children in time to come  ye have no part in the lord   
   therefore said we  that it shall be  when they should  so  say to us or to our generations in time to come  that we may say  again   behold the pattern of the altar of the lord  which our fathers made  not for burnt offerings  nor for sacrifices  but it  is  a witness between us and you   
   god forbid that we should rebel against the lord  and turn this day from following the lord  to build an altar for burnt offerings  for meat offerings  or for sacrifices  beside the altar of the lord our god that  is  before his tabernacle   
    and when phinehas the priest  and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of israel which  were  with him  heard the words that the children of reuben and the children of gad and the children of manasseh spake  it pleased them   
   and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest said unto the children of reuben  and to the children of gad  and to the children of manasseh  this day we perceive that the lord  is  among us  because ye have not committed this trespass against the lord  now ye have delivered the children of israel out of the hand of the lord   
   and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest  and the princes  returned from the children of reuben  and from the children of gad  out of the land of gilead  unto the land of canaan  to the children of israel  and brought them word again   
   and the thing pleased the children of israel  and the children of israel blessed god  and did not intend to go up against them in battle  to destroy the land wherein the children of reuben and gad dwelt   
   and the children of reuben and the children of gad called the altar  ed   for it  shall be  a witness between us that the lord  is  god   
joshua    
   and it came to pass a long time after that the lord had given rest unto israel from all their enemies round about  that joshua waxed old  and  stricken in age   
  and joshua called for all israel   and  for their elders  and for their heads  and for their judges  and for their officers  and said unto them  i am old  and  stricken in age   
  and ye have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto all these nations because of you  for the lord your god  is  he that hath fought for you   
  behold  i have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain  to be an inheritance for your tribes  from jordan  with all the nations that i have cut off  even unto the great sea westward   
  and the lord your god  he shall expel them from before you  and drive them from out of your sight  and ye shall possess their land  as the lord your god hath promised unto you   
  be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of moses  that ye turn not aside therefrom  to  the right hand or  to  the left   
  that ye come not among these nations  these that remain among you  neither make mention of the name of their gods  nor cause to swear  by them   neither serve them  nor bow yourselves unto them   
  but cleave unto the lord your god  as ye have done unto this day   
  for the lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong  but  as for  you  no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day   
   one man of you shall chase a thousand  for the lord your god  he  it is  that fighteth for you  as he hath promised you   
    take good heed therefore unto yourselves  that ye love the lord your god   
   else if ye do in any wise go back  and cleave unto the remnant of these nations   even  these that remain among you  and shall make marriages with them  and go in unto them  and they to you   
   know for a certainty that the lord your god will no more drive out  any of  these nations from before you  but they shall be snares and traps unto you  and scourges in your sides  and thorns in your eyes  until ye perish from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you   
   and  behold  this day i  am  going the way of all the earth  and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls  that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the lord your god spake concerning you  all are come to pass unto you   and  not one thing hath failed thereof   
   therefore it shall come to pass   that  as all good things are come upon you  which the lord your god promised you  so shall the lord bring upon you all evil things  until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you   
   when ye have transgressed the covenant of the lord your god  which he commanded you  and have gone and served other gods  and bowed yourselves to them  then shall the anger of the lord be kindled against you  and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you   
joshua    
   and joshua gathered all the tribes of israel to shechem  and called for the elders of israel  and for their heads  and for their judges  and for their officers  and they presented themselves before god   
  and joshua said unto all the people  thus saith the lord god of israel  your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time   even  terah  the father of abraham  and the father of nachor  and they served other gods   
  and i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood  and led him throughout all the land of canaan  and multiplied his seed  and gave him isaac   
  and i gave unto isaac jacob and esau  and i gave unto esau mount seir  to possess it  but jacob and his children went down into egypt   
  i sent moses also and aaron  and i plagued egypt  according to that which i did among them  and afterward i brought you out   
  and i brought your fathers out of egypt  and ye came unto the sea  and the egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the red sea   
  and when they cried unto the lord  he put darkness between you and the egyptians  and brought the sea upon them  and covered them  and your eyes have seen what i have done in egypt  and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season   
  and i brought you into the land of the amorites  which dwelt on the other side jordan  and they fought with you  and i gave them into your hand  that ye might possess their land  and i destroyed them from before you   
  then balak the son of zippor  king of moab  arose and warred against israel  and sent and called balaam the son of beor to curse you   
   but i would not hearken unto balaam  therefore he blessed you still  so i delivered you out of his hand   
   and ye went over jordan  and came unto jericho  and the men of jericho fought against you  the amorites  and the perizzites  and the canaanites  and the hittites  and the girgashites  the hivites  and the jebusites  and i delivered them into your hand   
   and i sent the hornet before you  which drave them out from before you   even  the two kings of the amorites   but  not with thy sword  nor with thy bow   
   and i have given you a land for which ye did not labour  and cities which ye built not  and ye dwell in them  of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat   
   now therefore fear the lord  and serve him in sincerity and in truth  and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood  and in egypt  and serve ye the lord   
    and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord  choose you this day whom ye will serve  whether the gods which your fathers served that  were  on the other side of the flood  or the gods of the amorites  in whose land ye dwell  but as for me and my house  we will serve the lord   
   and the people answered and said  god forbid that we should forsake the lord  to serve other gods   
   for the lord our god  he  it is  that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt  from the house of bondage  and which did those great signs in our sight  and preserved us in all the way wherein we went  and among all the people through whom we passed   
   and the lord drave out from before us all the people  even the amorites which dwelt in the land   therefore  will we also serve the lord  for he  is  our god   
   and joshua said unto the people  ye cannot serve the lord  for he  is  an holy god  he  is  a jealous god  he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins   
   if ye forsake the lord  and serve strange gods  then he will turn and do you hurt  and consume you  after that he hath done you good   
   and the people said unto joshua  nay  but we will serve the lord   
   and joshua said unto the people  ye  are  witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the lord  to serve him  and they said   we are  witnesses   
   now therefore put away   said he   the strange gods which  are  among you  and incline your heart unto the lord god of israel   
   and the people said unto joshua  the lord our god will we serve  and his voice will we obey   
   so joshua made a covenant with the people that day  and set them a statute and an ordinance in shechem   
   and joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of god  and took a great stone  and set it up there under an oak  that  was  by the sanctuary of the lord   
   and joshua said unto all the people  behold  this stone shall be a witness unto us  for it hath heard all the words of the lord which he spake unto us  it shall be therefore a witness unto you  lest ye deny your god   
   so joshua let the people depart  every man unto his inheritance   
    and it came to pass after these things  that joshua the son of nun  the servant of the lord  died   being  an hundred and ten years old   
   and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnathserah  which  is  in mount ephraim  on the north side of the hill of gaash   
   and israel served the lord all the days of joshua  and all the days of the elders that overlived joshua  and which had known all the works of the lord  that he had done for israel   
   and the bones of joseph  which the children of israel brought up out of egypt  buried they in shechem  in a parcel of ground which jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shechem for an hundred pieces of silver  and it became the inheritance of the children of joseph   
   and eleazar the son of aaron died  and they buried him in a hill  that pertained to  phinehas his son  which was given him in mount ephraim   
 
judges 
judges   
   now after the death of joshua it came to pass  that the children of israel asked the lord  saying  who shall go up for us against the canaanites first  to fight against them   
  and the lord said  judah shall go up  behold  i have delivered the land into his hand   
  and judah said unto simeon his brother  come up with me into my lot  that we may fight against the canaanites  and i likewise will go with thee into thy lot  so simeon went with him   
  and judah went up  and the lord delivered the canaanites and the perizzites into their hand  and they slew of them in bezek ten thousand men   
  and they found adonibezek in bezek  and they fought against him  and they slew the canaanites and the perizzites   
  but adonibezek fled  and they pursued after him  and caught him  and cut off his thumbs and his great toes   
  and adonibezek said  threescore and ten kings  having their thumbs and their great toes cut off  gathered  their meat  under my table  as i have done  so god hath requited me  and they brought him to jerusalem  and there he died   
  now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem  and had taken it  and smitten it with the edge of the sword  and set the city on fire   
   and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against the canaanites  that dwelt in the mountain  and in the south  and in the valley   
   and judah went against the canaanites that dwelt in hebron   now the name of hebron before  was  kirjatharba   and they slew sheshai  and ahiman  and talmai   
   and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir  and the name of debir before  was  kirjathsepher   
   and caleb said  he that smiteth kirjathsepher  and taketh it  to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife   
   and othniel the son of kenaz  caleb s younger brother  took it  and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife   
   and it came to pass  when she came  to him   that she moved him to ask of her father a field  and she lighted from off  her  ass  and caleb said unto her  what wilt thou   
   and she said unto him  give me a blessing  for thou hast given me a south land  give me also springs of water  and caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs   
   and the children of the kenite  moses  father in law  went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of judah into the wilderness of judah  which  lieth  in the south of arad  and they went and dwelt among the people   
   and judah went with simeon his brother  and they slew the canaanites that inhabited zephath  and utterly destroyed it  and the name of the city was called hormah   
   also judah took gaza with the coast thereof  and askelon with the coast thereof  and ekron with the coast thereof   
   and the lord was with judah  and he drave out  the inhabitants of  the mountain  but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley  because they had chariots of iron   
   and they gave hebron unto caleb  as moses said  and he expelled thence the three sons of anak   
    and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem  but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day   
   and the house of joseph  they also went up against bethel  and the lord  was  with them   
   and the house of joseph sent to descry bethel   now the name of the city before  was  luz    
   and the spies saw a man come forth out of the city  and they said unto him  shew us  we pray thee  the entrance into the city  and we will shew thee mercy   
   and when he shewed them the entrance into the city  they smote the city with the edge of the sword  but they let go the man and all his family   
   and the man went into the land of the hittites  and built a city  and called the name thereof luz  which  is  the name thereof unto this day   
   neither did manasseh drive out  the inhabitants of  bethshean and her towns  nor taanach and her towns  nor the inhabitants of dor and her towns  nor the inhabitants of ibleam and her towns  nor the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns  but the canaanites would dwell in that land   
   and it came to pass  when israel was strong  that they put the canaanites to tribute  and did not utterly drive them out   
   neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer  but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them   
   neither did zebulun drive out the inhabitants of kitron  nor the inhabitants of nahalol  but the canaanites dwelt among them  and became tributaries   
   neither did asher drive out the inhabitants of accho  nor the inhabitants of zidon  nor of ahlab  nor of achzib  nor of helbah  nor of aphik  nor of rehob   
   but the asherites dwelt among the canaanites  the inhabitants of the land  for they did not drive them out   
   neither did naphtali drive out the inhabitants of bethshemesh  nor the inhabitants of bethanath  but he dwelt among the canaanites  the inhabitants of the land  nevertheless the inhabitants of bethshemesh and of bethanath became tributaries unto them   
   and the amorites forced the children of dan into the mountain  for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley   
   but the amorites would dwell in mount heres in aijalon  and in shaalbim  yet the hand of the house of joseph prevailed  so that they became tributaries   
   and the coast of the amorites  was  from the going up to akrabbim  from the rock  and upward   
judges   
   and an angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim  and said  i made you to go up out of egypt  and have brought you unto the land which i sware unto your fathers  and i said  i will never break my covenant with you   
  and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land  ye shall throw down their altars  but ye have not obeyed my voice  why have ye done this   
  wherefore i also said  i will not drive them out from before you  but they shall be  as thorns  in your sides  and their gods shall be a snare unto you   
  and it came to pass  when the angel of the lord spake these words unto all the children of israel  that the people lifted up their voice  and wept   
  and they called the name of that place bochim  and they sacrificed there unto the lord   
   and when joshua had let the people go  the children of israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land   
  and the people served the lord all the days of joshua  and all the days of the elders that outlived joshua  who had seen all the great works of the lord  that he did for israel   
  and joshua the son of nun  the servant of the lord  died   being  an hundred and ten years old   
  and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnathheres  in the mount of ephraim  on the north side of the hill gaash   
   and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers  and there arose another generation after them  which knew not the lord  nor yet the works which he had done for israel   
   and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord  and served baalim   
   and they forsook the lord god of their fathers  which brought them out of the land of egypt  and followed other gods  of the gods of the people that  were  round about them  and bowed themselves unto them  and provoked the lord to anger   
   and they forsook the lord  and served baal and ashtaroth   
   and the anger of the lord was hot against israel  and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them  and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about  so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies   
   whithersoever they went out  the hand of the lord was against them for evil  as the lord had said  and as the lord had sworn unto them  and they were greatly distressed   
   nevertheless the lord raised up judges  which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them   
   and yet they would not hearken unto their judges  but they went a whoring after other gods  and bowed themselves unto them  they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in  obeying the commandments of the lord   but  they did not so   
   and when the lord raised them up judges  then the lord was with the judge  and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge  for it repented the lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them   
   and it came to pass  when the judge was dead   that  they returned  and corrupted  themselves  more than their fathers  in following other gods to serve them  and to bow down unto them  they ceased not from their own doings  nor from their stubborn way   
   and the anger of the lord was hot against israel  and he said  because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which i commanded their fathers  and have not hearkened unto my voice   
   i also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which joshua left when he died   
   that through them i may prove israel  whether they will keep the way of the lord to walk therein  as their fathers did keep  it   or not   
   therefore the lord left those nations  without driving them out hastily  neither delivered he them into the hand of joshua   
judges   
   now these  are  the nations which the lord left  to prove israel by them   even  as many  of israel  as had not known all the wars of canaan   
  only that the generations of the children of israel might know  to teach them war  at the least such as before knew nothing thereof   
   namely   five lords of the philistines  and all the canaanites  and the sidonians  and the hivites that dwelt in mount lebanon  from mount baalhermon unto the entering in of hamath   
  and they were to prove israel by them  to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the lord  which he commanded their fathers by the hand of moses   
  and the children of israel dwelt among the canaanites  hittites  and amorites  and perizzites  and hivites  and jebusites   
  and they took their daughters to be their wives  and gave their daughters to their sons  and served their gods   
  and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord  and forgat the lord their god  and served baalim and the groves   
   therefore the anger of the lord was hot against israel  and he sold them into the hand of chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia  and the children of israel served chushanrishathaim eight years   
  and when the children of israel cried unto the lord  the lord raised up a deliverer to the children of israel  who delivered them   even  othniel the son of kenaz  caleb s younger brother   
   and the spirit of the lord came upon him  and he judged israel  and went out to war  and the lord delivered chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia into his hand  and his hand prevailed against chushanrishathaim   
   and the land had rest forty years  and othniel the son of kenaz died   
    and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord  and the lord strengthened eglon the king of moab against israel  because they had done evil in the sight of the lord   
   and he gathered unto him the children of ammon and amalek  and went and smote israel  and possessed the city of palm trees   
   so the children of israel served eglon the king of moab eighteen years   
   but when the children of israel cried unto the lord  the lord raised them up a deliverer  ehud the son of gera  a benjamite  a man lefthanded  and by him the children of israel sent a present unto eglon the king of moab   
   but ehud made him a dagger which had two edges  of a cubit length  and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh   
   and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab  and eglon  was  a very fat man   
   and when he had made an end to offer the present  he sent away the people that bare the present   
   but he himself turned again from the quarries that  were  by gilgal  and said  i have a secret errand unto thee  o king  who said  keep silence  and all that stood by him went out from him   
   and ehud came unto him  and he was sitting in a summer parlour  which he had for himself alone  and ehud said  i have a message from god unto thee  and he arose out of  his  seat   
   and ehud put forth his left hand  and took the dagger from his right thigh  and thrust it into his belly   
   and the haft also went in after the blade  and the fat closed upon the blade  so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly  and the dirt came out   
   then ehud went forth through the porch  and shut the doors of the parlour upon him  and locked them   
   when he was gone out  his servants came  and when they saw that  behold  the doors of the parlour  were  locked  they said  surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber   
   and they tarried till they were ashamed  and  behold  he opened not the doors of the parlour  therefore they took a key  and opened  them   and  behold  their lord  was  fallen down dead on the earth   
   and ehud escaped while they tarried  and passed beyond the quarries  and escaped unto seirath   
   and it came to pass  when he was come  that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of ephraim  and the children of israel went down with him from the mount  and he before them   
   and he said unto them  follow after me  for the lord hath delivered your enemies the moabites into your hand  and they went down after him  and took the fords of jordan toward moab  and suffered not a man to pass over   
   and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men  all lusty  and all men of valour  and there escaped not a man   
   so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel  and the land had rest fourscore years   
    and after him was shamgar the son of anath  which slew of the philistines six hundred men with an ox goad  and he also delivered israel   
judges   
   and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the lord  when ehud was dead   
  and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan  that reigned in hazor  the captain of whose host  was  sisera  which dwelt in harosheth of the gentiles   
  and the children of israel cried unto the lord  for he had nine hundred chariots of iron  and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of israel   
   and deborah  a prophetess  the wife of lapidoth  she judged israel at that time   
  and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and bethel in mount ephraim  and the children of israel came up to her for judgment   
  and she sent and called barak the son of abinoam out of kedeshnaphtali  and said unto him  hath not the lord god of israel commanded   saying   go and draw toward mount tabor  and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of zebulun   
  and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera  the captain of jabin s army  with his chariots and his multitude  and i will deliver him into thine hand   
  and barak said unto her  if thou wilt go with me  then i will go  but if thou wilt not go with me   then  i will not go   
  and she said  i will surely go with thee  notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour  for the lord shall sell sisera into the hand of a woman  and deborah arose  and went with barak to kedesh   
    and barak called zebulun and naphtali to kedesh  and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet  and deborah went up with him   
   now heber the kenite   which was  of the children of hobab the father in law of moses  had severed himself from the kenites  and pitched his tent unto the plain of zaanaim  which  is  by kedesh   
   and they shewed sisera that barak the son of abinoam was gone up to mount tabor   
   and sisera gathered together all his chariots   even  nine hundred chariots of iron  and all the people that  were  with him  from harosheth of the gentiles unto the river of kishon   
   and deborah said unto barak  up  for this  is  the day in which the lord hath delivered sisera into thine hand  is not the lord gone out before thee  so barak went down from mount tabor  and ten thousand men after him   
   and the lord discomfited sisera  and all  his  chariots  and all  his  host  with the edge of the sword before barak  so that sisera lighted down off  his  chariot  and fled away on his feet   
   but barak pursued after the chariots  and after the host  unto harosheth of the gentiles  and all the host of sisera fell upon the edge of the sword   and  there was not a man left   
    howbeit sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of jael the wife of heber the kenite  for  there was  peace between jabin the king of hazor and the house of heber the kenite   
   and jael went out to meet sisera  and said unto him  turn in  my lord  turn in to me  fear not  and when he had turned in unto her into the tent  she covered him with a mantle   
   and he said unto her  give me  i pray thee  a little water to drink  for i am thirsty  and she opened a bottle of milk  and gave him drink  and covered him   
   again he said unto her  stand in the door of the tent  and it shall be  when any man doth come and enquire of thee  and say  is there any man here  that thou shalt say  no   
   then jael heber s wife took a nail of the tent  and took an hammer in her hand  and went softly unto him  and smote the nail into his temples  and fastened it into the ground  for he was fast asleep and weary  so he died   
   and  behold  as barak pursued sisera  jael came out to meet him  and said unto him  come  and i will shew thee the man whom thou seekest  and when he came into her  tent   behold  sisera lay dead  and the nail  was  in his temples   
   so god subdued on that day jabin the king of canaan before the children of israel   
   and the hand of the children of israel prospered  and prevailed against jabin the king of canaan  until they had destroyed jabin king of canaan   
judges   
   then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day  saying   
  praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel  when the people willingly offered themselves   
  hear  o ye kings  give ear  o ye princes  i   even  i  will sing unto the lord  i will sing  praise  to the lord god of israel   
  lord  when thou wentest out of seir  when thou marchedst out of the field of edom  the earth trembled  and the heavens dropped  the clouds also dropped water   
  the mountains melted from before the lord   even  that sinai from before the lord god of israel   
   in the days of shamgar the son of anath  in the days of jael  the highways were unoccupied  and the travellers walked through byways   
   the inhabitants of  the villages ceased  they ceased in israel  until that i deborah arose  that i arose a mother in israel   
  they chose new gods  then  was  war in the gates  was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in israel   
  my heart  is  toward the governors of israel  that offered themselves willingly among the people  bless ye the lord   
   speak  ye that ride on white asses  ye that sit in judgment  and walk by the way   
    they that are delivered  from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water  there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the lord   even  the righteous acts  toward the inhabitants  of his villages in israel  then shall the people of the lord go down to the gates   
    awake  awake  deborah  awake  awake  utter a song  arise  barak  and lead thy captivity captive  thou son of abinoam   
   then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people  the lord made me have dominion over the mighty   
   out of ephraim  was there  a root of them against amalek  after thee  benjamin  among thy people  out of machir came down governors  and out of zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer   
   and the princes of issachar  were  with deborah  even issachar  and also barak  he was sent on foot into the valley  for the divisions of reuben  there were  great thoughts of heart   
   why abodest thou among the sheepfolds  to hear the bleatings of the flocks  for the divisions of reuben  there were  great searchings of heart   
   gilead abode beyond jordan  and why did dan remain in ships  asher continued on the sea shore  and abode in his breaches   
   zebulun and naphtali  were  a people  that  jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field   
   the kings came  and  fought  then fought the kings of canaan in taanach by the waters of megiddo  they took no gain of money   
   they fought from heaven  the stars in their courses fought against sisera   
   the river of kishon swept them away  that ancient river  the river kishon  o my soul  thou hast trodden down strength   
   then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings  the pransings of their mighty ones   
   curse ye meroz  said the angel of the lord  curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof  because they came not to the help of the lord  to the help of the lord against the mighty   
    blessed above women shall jael the wife of heber the kenite be  blessed shall she be above women in the tent   
   he asked water   and  she gave  him  milk  she brought forth butter in a lordly dish   
   she put her hand to the nail  and her right hand to the workmen s hammer  and with the hammer she smote sisera  she smote off his head  when she had pierced and stricken through his temples   
   at her feet he bowed  he fell  he lay down  at her feet he bowed  he fell  where he bowed  there he fell down dead   
   the mother of sisera looked out at a window  and cried through the lattice  why is his chariot  so  long in coming  why tarry the wheels of his chariots   
   her wise ladies answered her  yea  she returned answer to herself   
   have they not sped  have they  not  divided the prey  to every man a damsel  or  two  to sisera a prey of divers colours  a prey of divers colours of needlework  of divers colours of needlework on both sides   meet  for the necks of  them that take  the spoil   
   so let all thine enemies perish  o lord  but  let  them that love him  be  as the sun when he goeth forth in his might  and the land had rest forty years   
judges   
   and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord  and the lord delivered them into the hand of midian seven years   
  and the hand of midian prevailed against israel   and  because of the midianites the children of israel made them the dens which  are  in the mountains  and caves  and strong holds   
  and  so  it was  when israel had sown  that the midianites came up  and the amalekites  and the children of the east  even they came up against them   
  and they encamped against them  and destroyed the increase of the earth  till thou come unto gaza  and left no sustenance for israel  neither sheep  nor ox  nor ass   
  for they came up with their cattle and their tents  and they came as grasshoppers for multitude   for  both they and their camels were without number  and they entered into the land to destroy it   
  and israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites  and the children of israel cried unto the lord   
   and it came to pass  when the children of israel cried unto the lord because of the midianites   
  that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel  which said unto them  thus saith the lord god of israel  i brought you up from egypt  and brought you forth out of the house of bondage   
  and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians  and out of the hand of all that oppressed you  and drave them out from before you  and gave you their land   
   and i said unto you  i  am  the lord your god  fear not the gods of the amorites  in whose land ye dwell  but ye have not obeyed my voice   
    and there came an angel of the lord  and sat under an oak which  was  in ophrah  that  pertained  unto joash the abiezrite  and his son gideon threshed wheat by the winepress  to hide  it  from the midianites   
   and the angel of the lord appeared unto him  and said unto him  the lord  is  with thee  thou mighty man of valour   
   and gideon said unto him  oh my lord  if the lord be with us  why then is all this befallen us  and where  be  all his miracles which our fathers told us of  saying  did not the lord bring us up from egypt  but now the lord hath forsaken us  and delivered us into the hands of the midianites   
   and the lord looked upon him  and said  go in this thy might  and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites  have not i sent thee   
   and he said unto him  oh my lord  wherewith shall i save israel  behold  my family  is  poor in manasseh  and i  am  the least in my father s house   
   and the lord said unto him  surely i will be with thee  and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man   
   and he said unto him  if now i have found grace in thy sight  then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me   
   depart not hence  i pray thee  until i come unto thee  and bring forth my present  and set  it  before thee  and he said  i will tarry until thou come again   
   and gideon went in  and made ready a kid  and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour  the flesh he put in a basket  and he put the broth in a pot  and brought  it  out unto him under the oak  and presented  it    
   and the angel of god said unto him  take the flesh and the unleavened cakes  and lay  them  upon this rock  and pour out the broth  and he did so   
   then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that  was  in his hand  and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes  and there rose up fire out of the rock  and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes  then the angel of the lord departed out of his sight   
   and when gideon perceived that he  was  an angel of the lord  gideon said  alas  o lord god  for because i have seen an angel of the lord face to face   
   and the lord said unto him  peace  be  unto thee  fear not  thou shalt not die   
   then gideon built an altar there unto the lord  and called it jehovahshalom  unto this day it  is  yet in ophrah of the abiezrites   
    and it came to pass the same night  that the lord said unto him  take thy father s young bullock  even the second bullock of seven years old  and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath  and cut down the grove that  is  by it   
   and build an altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock  in the ordered place  and take the second bullock  and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down   
   then gideon took ten men of his servants  and did as the lord had said unto him  and  so  it was  because he feared his father s household  and the men of the city  that he could not do  it  by day  that he did  it  by night   
   and when the men of the city arose early in the morning  behold  the altar of baal was cast down  and the grove was cut down that  was  by it  and the second bullock was offered upon the altar  that was  built   
   and they said one to another  who hath done this thing  and when they enquired and asked  they said  gideon the son of joash hath done this thing   
   then the men of the city said unto joash  bring out thy son  that he may die  because he hath cast down the altar of baal  and because he hath cut down the grove that  was  by it   
   and joash said unto all that stood against him  will ye plead for baal  will ye save him  he that will plead for him  let him be put to death whilst  it is yet  morning  if he  be  a god  let him plead for himself  because  one  hath cast down his altar   
   therefore on that day he called him jerubbaal  saying  let baal plead against him  because he hath thrown down his altar   
    then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together  and went over  and pitched in the valley of jezreel   
   but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon  and he blew a trumpet  and abiezer was gathered after him   
   and he sent messengers throughout all manasseh  who also was gathered after him  and he sent messengers unto asher  and unto zebulun  and unto naphtali  and they came up to meet them   
   and gideon said unto god  if thou wilt save israel by mine hand  as thou hast said   
   behold  i will put a fleece of wool in the floor   and  if the dew be on the fleece only  and  it be  dry upon all the earth  beside   then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine hand  as thou hast said   
   and it was so  for he rose up early on the morrow  and thrust the fleece together  and wringed the dew out of the fleece  a bowl full of water   
   and gideon said unto god  let not thine anger be hot against me  and i will speak but this once  let me prove  i pray thee  but this once with the fleece  let it now be dry only upon the fleece  and upon all the ground let there be dew   
   and god did so that night  for it was dry upon the fleece only  and there was dew on all the ground   
judges   
   then jerubbaal  who  is  gideon  and all the people that  were  with him  rose up early  and pitched beside the well of harod  so that the host of the midianites were on the north side of them  by the hill of moreh  in the valley   
  and the lord said unto gideon  the people that  are  with thee  are  too many for me to give the midianites into their hands  lest israel vaunt themselves against me  saying  mine own hand hath saved me   
  now therefore go to  proclaim in the ears of the people  saying  whosoever  is  fearful and afraid  let him return and depart early from mount gilead  and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand  and there remained ten thousand   
  and the lord said unto gideon  the people  are  yet  too  many  bring them down unto the water  and i will try them for thee there  and it shall be   that  of whom i say unto thee  this shall go with thee  the same shall go with thee  and of whomsoever i say unto thee  this shall not go with thee  the same shall not go   
  so he brought down the people unto the water  and the lord said unto gideon  every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue  as a dog lappeth  him shalt thou set by himself  likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink   
  and the number of them that lapped   putting  their hand to their mouth  were three hundred men  but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water   
  and the lord said unto gideon  by the three hundred men that lapped will i save you  and deliver the midianites into thine hand  and let all the  other  people go every man unto his place   
  so the people took victuals in their hand  and their trumpets  and he sent all  the rest of  israel every man unto his tent  and retained those three hundred men  and the host of midian was beneath him in the valley   
   and it came to pass the same night  that the lord said unto him  arise  get thee down unto the host  for i have delivered it into thine hand   
   but if thou fear to go down  go thou with phurah thy servant down to the host   
   and thou shalt hear what they say  and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host  then went he down with phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that  were  in the host   
   and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude  and their camels  were  without number  as the sand by the sea side for multitude   
   and when gideon was come  behold   there was  a man that told a dream unto his fellow  and said  behold  i dreamed a dream  and  lo  a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of midian  and came unto a tent  and smote it that it fell  and overturned it  that the tent lay along   
   and his fellow answered and said  this  is  nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash  a man of israel   for  into his hand hath god delivered midian  and all the host   
   and it was  so   when gideon heard the telling of the dream  and the interpretation thereof  that he worshipped  and returned into the host of israel  and said  arise  for the lord hath delivered into your hand the host of midian   
    and he divided the three hundred men  into  three companies  and he put a trumpet in every man s hand  with empty pitchers  and lamps within the pitchers   
   and he said unto them  look on me  and do likewise  and  behold  when i come to the outside of the camp  it shall be  that   as i do  so shall ye do   
   when i blow with a trumpet  i and all that  are  with me  then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp  and say   the sword  of the lord  and of gideon   
   so gideon  and the hundred men that  were  with him  came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch  and they had but newly set the watch  and they blew the trumpets  and brake the pitchers that  were  in their hands   
   and the three companies blew the trumpets  and brake the pitchers  and held the lamps in their left hands  and the trumpets in their right hands to blow  withal   and they cried  the sword of the lord  and of gideon   
   and they stood every man in his place round about the camp  and all the host ran  and cried  and fled   
   and the three hundred blew the trumpets  and the lord set every man s sword against his fellow  even throughout all the host  and the host fled to bethshittah in zererath   and  to the border of abelmeholah  unto tabbath   
    and the men of israel gathered themselves together out of naphtali  and out of asher  and out of all manasseh  and pursued after the midianites   
   and gideon sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim  saying  come down against the midianites  and take before them the waters unto bethbarah and jordan  then all the men of ephraim gathered themselves together  and took the waters unto bethbarah and jordan   
   and they took two princes of the midianites  oreb and zeeb  and they slew oreb upon the rock oreb  and zeeb they slew at the winepress of zeeb  and pursued midian  and brought the heads of oreb and zeeb to gideon on the other side jordan   
judges   
   and the men of ephraim said unto him  why hast thou served us thus  that thou calledst us not  when thou wentest to fight with the midianites  and they did chide with him sharply   
  and he said unto them  what have i done now in comparison of you   is  not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage of abiezer   
  god hath delivered into your hands the princes of midian  oreb and zeeb  and what was i able to do in comparison of you  then their anger was abated toward him  when he had said that   
   and gideon came to jordan   and  passed over  he  and the three hundred men that  were  with him  faint  yet pursuing  them    
  and he said unto the men of succoth  give  i pray you  loaves of bread unto the people that follow me  for they  be  faint  and i am pursuing after zebah and zalmunna  kings of midian   
  and the princes of succoth said   are  the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand  that we should give bread unto thine army   
  and gideon said  therefore when the lord hath delivered zebah and zalmunna into mine hand  then i will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers   
  and he went up thence to penuel  and spake unto them likewise  and the men of penuel answered him as the men of succoth had answered  him    
  and he spake also unto the men of penuel  saying  when i come again in peace  i will break down this tower   
   now zebah and zalmunna  were  in karkor  and their hosts with them  about fifteen thousand  men   all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east  for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword   
   and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of nobah and jogbehah  and smote the host  for the host was secure   
   and when zebah and zalmunna fled  he pursued after them  and took the two kings of midian  zebah and zalmunna  and discomfited all the host   
   and gideon the son of joash returned from battle before the sun  was up    
   and caught a young man of the men of succoth  and enquired of him  and he described unto him the princes of succoth  and the elders thereof   even  threescore and seventeen men   
   and he came unto the men of succoth  and said  behold zebah and zalmunna  with whom ye did upbraid me  saying   are  the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand  that we should give bread unto thy men  that are  weary   
   and he took the elders of the city  and thorns of the wilderness and briers  and with them he taught the men of succoth   
   and he beat down the tower of penuel  and slew the men of the city   
    then said he unto zebah and zalmunna  what manner of men  were they  whom ye slew at tabor  and they answered  as thou  art   so  were  they  each one resembled the children of a king   
   and he said  they  were  my brethren   even  the sons of my mother   as  the lord liveth  if ye had saved them alive  i would not slay you   
   and he said unto jether his firstborn  up   and  slay them  but the youth drew not his sword  for he feared  because he  was  yet a youth   
   then zebah and zalmunna said  rise thou  and fall upon us  for as the man  is  so is  his strength  and gideon arose  and slew zebah and zalmunna  and took away the ornaments that  were  on their camels  necks   
    then the men of israel said unto gideon  rule thou over us  both thou  and thy son  and thy son s son also  for thou hast delivered us from the hand of midian   
   and gideon said unto them  i will not rule over you  neither shall my son rule over you  the lord shall rule over you   
   and gideon said unto them  i would desire a request of you  that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey   for they had golden earrings  because they  were  ishmaelites    
   and they answered  we will willingly give  them   and they spread a garment  and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey   
   and the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred  shekels  of gold  beside ornaments  and collars  and purple raiment that  was  on the kings of midian  and beside the chains that  were  about their camels  necks   
   and gideon made an ephod thereof  and put it in his city   even  in ophrah  and all israel went thither a whoring after it  which thing became a snare unto gideon  and to his house   
   thus was midian subdued before the children of israel  so that they lifted up their heads no more  and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of gideon   
    and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house   
   and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten  for he had many wives   
   and his concubine that  was  in shechem  she also bare him a son  whose name he called abimelech   
   and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age  and was buried in the sepulchre of joash his father  in ophrah of the abiezrites   
   and it came to pass  as soon as gideon was dead  that the children of israel turned again  and went a whoring after baalim  and made baalberith their god   
   and the children of israel remembered not the lord their god  who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side   
   neither shewed they kindness to the house of jerubbaal   namely   gideon  according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto israel   
judges   
   and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his mother s brethren  and communed with them  and with all the family of the house of his mother s father  saying   
  speak  i pray you  in the ears of all the men of shechem  whether  is  better for you  either that all the sons of jerubbaal   which are  threescore and ten persons  reign over you  or that one reign over you  remember also that i  am  your bone and your flesh   
  and his mother s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of shechem all these words  and their hearts inclined to follow abimelech  for they said  he  is  our brother   
  and they gave him threescore and ten  pieces  of silver out of the house of baalberith  wherewith abimelech hired vain and light persons  which followed him   
  and he went unto his father s house at ophrah  and slew his brethren the sons of jerubbaal   being  threescore and ten persons  upon one stone  notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal was left  for he hid himself   
  and all the men of shechem gathered together  and all the house of millo  and went  and made abimelech king  by the plain of the pillar that  was  in shechem   
   and when they told  it  to jotham  he went and stood in the top of mount gerizim  and lifted up his voice  and cried  and said unto them  hearken unto me  ye men of shechem  that god may hearken unto you   
  the trees went forth  on a time  to anoint a king over them  and they said unto the olive tree  reign thou over us   
  but the olive tree said unto them  should i leave my fatness  wherewith by me they honour god and man  and go to be promoted over the trees   
   and the trees said to the fig tree  come thou   and  reign over us   
   but the fig tree said unto them  should i forsake my sweetness  and my good fruit  and go to be promoted over the trees   
   then said the trees unto the vine  come thou   and  reign over us   
   and the vine said unto them  should i leave my wine  which cheereth god and man  and go to be promoted over the trees   
   then said all the trees unto the bramble  come thou   and  reign over us   
   and the bramble said unto the trees  if in truth ye anoint me king over you   then  come  and  put your trust in my shadow  and if not  let fire come out of the bramble  and devour the cedars of lebanon   
   now therefore  if ye have done truly and sincerely  in that ye have made abimelech king  and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal and his house  and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands   
    for my father fought for you  and adventured his life far  and delivered you out of the hand of midian   
   and ye are risen up against my father s house this day  and have slain his sons  threescore and ten persons  upon one stone  and have made abimelech  the son of his maidservant  king over the men of shechem  because he  is  your brother    
   if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with jerubbaal and with his house this day   then  rejoice ye in abimelech  and let him also rejoice in you   
   but if not  let fire come out from abimelech  and devour the men of shechem  and the house of millo  and let fire come out from the men of shechem  and from the house of millo  and devour abimelech   
   and jotham ran away  and fled  and went to beer  and dwelt there  for fear of abimelech his brother   
    when abimelech had reigned three years over israel   
   then god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem  and the men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech   
   that the cruelty  done  to the threescore and ten sons of jerubbaal might come  and their blood be laid upon abimelech their brother  which slew them  and upon the men of shechem  which aided him in the killing of his brethren   
   and the men of shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains  and they robbed all that came along that way by them  and it was told abimelech   
   and gaal the son of ebed came with his brethren  and went over to shechem  and the men of shechem put their confidence in him   
   and they went out into the fields  and gathered their vineyards  and trode  the grapes   and made merry  and went into the house of their god  and did eat and drink  and cursed abimelech   
   and gaal the son of ebed said  who  is  abimelech  and who  is  shechem  that we should serve him   is  not  he  the son of jerubbaal  and zebul his officer  serve the men of hamor the father of shechem  for why should we serve him   
   and would to god this people were under my hand  then would i remove abimelech  and he said to abimelech  increase thine army  and come out   
   and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of gaal the son of ebed  his anger was kindled   
   and he sent messengers unto abimelech privily  saying  behold  gaal the son of ebed and his brethren be come to shechem  and  behold  they fortify the city against thee   
   now therefore up by night  thou and the people that  is  with thee  and lie in wait in the field   
   and it shall be   that  in the morning  as soon as the sun is up  thou shalt rise early  and set upon the city  and  behold   when  he and the people that  is  with him come out against thee  then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion   
   and abimelech rose up  and all the people that  were  with him  by night  and they laid wait against shechem in four companies   
   and gaal the son of ebed went out  and stood in the entering of the gate of the city  and abimelech rose up  and the people that  were  with him  from lying in wait   
   and when gaal saw the people  he said to zebul  behold  there come people down from the top of the mountains  and zebul said unto him  thou seest the shadow of the mountains as  if they were  men   
   and gaal spake again and said  see there come people down by the middle of the land  and another company come along by the plain of meonenim   
   then said zebul unto him  where  is  now thy mouth  wherewith thou saidst  who  is  abimelech  that we should serve him   is  not this the people that thou hast despised  go out  i pray now  and fight with them   
   and gaal went out before the men of shechem  and fought with abimelech   
   and abimelech chased him  and he fled before him  and many were overthrown  and  wounded   even  unto the entering of the gate   
   and abimelech dwelt at arumah  and zebul thrust out gaal and his brethren  that they should not dwell in shechem   
   and it came to pass on the morrow  that the people went out into the field  and they told abimelech   
   and he took the people  and divided them into three companies  and laid wait in the field  and looked  and  behold  the people  were  come forth out of the city  and he rose up against them  and smote them   
   and abimelech  and the company that  was  with him  rushed forward  and stood in the entering of the gate of the city  and the two  other  companies ran upon all  the people  that  were  in the fields  and slew them   
   and abimelech fought against the city all that day  and he took the city  and slew the people that  was  therein  and beat down the city  and sowed it with salt   
   and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard  that   they entered into an hold of the house of the god berith   
   and it was told abimelech  that all the men of the tower of shechem were gathered together   
   and abimelech gat him up to mount zalmon  he and all the people that  were  with him  and abimelech took an axe in his hand  and cut down a bough from the trees  and took it  and laid  it  on his shoulder  and said unto the people that  were  with him  what ye have seen me do  make haste   and  do as i  have done    
   and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough  and followed abimelech  and put  them  to the hold  and set the hold on fire upon them  so that all the men of the tower of shechem died also  about a thousand men and women   
    then went abimelech to thebez  and encamped against thebez  and took it   
   but there was a strong tower within the city  and thither fled all the men and women  and all they of the city  and shut  it  to them  and gat them up to the top of the tower   
   and abimelech came unto the tower  and fought against it  and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire   
   and a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon abimelech s head  and all to brake his skull   
   then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer  and said unto him  draw thy sword  and slay me  that men say not of me  a woman slew him  and his young man thrust him through  and he died   
   and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead  they departed every man unto his place   
   thus god rendered the wickedness of abimelech  which he did unto his father  in slaying his seventy brethren   
   and all the evil of the men of shechem did god render upon their heads  and upon them came the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal   
judges    
   and after abimelech there arose to defend israel tola the son of puah  the son of dodo  a man of issachar  and he dwelt in shamir in mount ephraim   
  and he judged israel twenty and three years  and died  and was buried in shamir   
  and after him arose jair  a gileadite  and judged israel twenty and two years   
  and he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts  and they had thirty cities  which are called havothjair unto this day  which  are  in the land of gilead   
  and jair died  and was buried in camon   
   and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord  and served baalim  and ashtaroth  and the gods of syria  and the gods of zidon  and the gods of moab  and the gods of the children of ammon  and the gods of the philistines  and forsook the lord  and served not him   
  and the anger of the lord was hot against israel  and he sold them into the hands of the philistines  and into the hands of the children of ammon   
  and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of israel  eighteen years  all the children of israel that  were  on the other side jordan in the land of the amorites  which  is  in gilead   
  moreover the children of ammon passed over jordan to fight also against judah  and against benjamin  and against the house of ephraim  so that israel was sore distressed   
    and the children of israel cried unto the lord  saying  we have sinned against thee  both because we have forsaken our god  and also served baalim   
   and the lord said unto the children of israel   did  not  i deliver you  from the egyptians  and from the amorites  from the children of ammon  and from the philistines   
   the zidonians also  and the amalekites  and the maonites  did oppress you  and ye cried to me  and i delivered you out of their hand   
   yet ye have forsaken me  and served other gods  wherefore i will deliver you no more   
   go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen  let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation   
   and the children of israel said unto the lord  we have sinned  do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee  deliver us only  we pray thee  this day   
   and they put away the strange gods from among them  and served the lord  and his soul was grieved for the misery of israel   
   then the children of ammon were gathered together  and encamped in gilead  and the children of israel assembled themselves together  and encamped in mizpeh   
   and the people  and  princes of gilead said one to another  what man  is he  that will begin to fight against the children of ammon  he shall be head over all the inhabitants of gilead   
judges    
   now jephthah the gileadite was a mighty man of valour  and he  was  the son of an harlot  and gilead begat jephthah   
  and gilead s wife bare him sons  and his wife s sons grew up  and they thrust out jephthah  and said unto him  thou shalt not inherit in our father s house  for thou  art  the son of a strange woman   
  then jephthah fled from his brethren  and dwelt in the land of tob  and there were gathered vain men to jephthah  and went out with him   
   and it came to pass in process of time  that the children of ammon made war against israel   
  and it was so  that when the children of ammon made war against israel  the elders of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of tob   
  and they said unto jephthah  come  and be our captain  that we may fight with the children of ammon   
  and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead  did not ye hate me  and expel me out of my father s house  and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress   
  and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah  therefore we turn again to thee now  that thou mayest go with us  and fight against the children of ammon  and be our head over all the inhabitants of gilead   
  and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead  if ye bring me home again to fight against the children of ammon  and the lord deliver them before me  shall i be your head   
   and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah  the lord be witness between us  if we do not so according to thy words   
   then jephthah went with the elders of gilead  and the people made him head and captain over them  and jephthah uttered all his words before the lord in mizpeh   
    and jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of ammon  saying  what hast thou to do with me  that thou art come against me to fight in my land   
   and the king of the children of ammon answered unto the messengers of jephthah  because israel took away my land  when they came up out of egypt  from arnon even unto jabbok  and unto jordan  now therefore restore those  lands  again peaceably   
   and jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of ammon   
   and said unto him  thus saith jephthah  israel took not away the land of moab  nor the land of the children of ammon   
   but when israel came up from egypt  and walked through the wilderness unto the red sea  and came to kadesh   
   then israel sent messengers unto the king of edom  saying  let me  i pray thee  pass through thy land  but the king of edom would not hearken  thereto   and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab  but he would not  consent   and israel abode in kadesh   
   then they went along through the wilderness  and compassed the land of edom  and the land of moab  and came by the east side of the land of moab  and pitched on the other side of arnon  but came not within the border of moab  for arnon  was  the border of moab   
   and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites  the king of heshbon  and israel said unto him  let us pass  we pray thee  through thy land into my place   
   but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his coast  but sihon gathered all his people together  and pitched in jahaz  and fought against israel   
   and the lord god of israel delivered sihon and all his people into the hand of israel  and they smote them  so israel possessed all the land of the amorites  the inhabitants of that country   
   and they possessed all the coasts of the amorites  from arnon even unto jabbok  and from the wilderness even unto jordan   
   so now the lord god of israel hath dispossessed the amorites from before his people israel  and shouldest thou possess it   
   wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess  so whomsoever the lord our god shall drive out from before us  them will we possess   
   and now  art  thou any thing better than balak the son of zippor  king of moab  did he ever strive against israel  or did he ever fight against them   
   while israel dwelt in heshbon and her towns  and in aroer and her towns  and in all the cities that  be  along by the coasts of arnon  three hundred years  why therefore did ye not recover  them  within that time   
   wherefore i have not sinned against thee  but thou doest me wrong to war against me  the lord the judge be judge this day between the children of israel and the children of ammon   
   howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the words of jephthah which he sent him   
    then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah  and he passed over gilead  and manasseh  and passed over mizpeh of gilead  and from mizpeh of gilead he passed over  unto  the children of ammon   
   and jephthah vowed a vow unto the lord  and said  if thou shalt without fail deliver the children of ammon into mine hands   
   then it shall be  that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me  when i return in peace from the children of ammon  shall surely be the lord s  and i will offer it up for a burnt offering   
   so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fight against them  and the lord delivered them into his hands   
   and he smote them from aroer  even till thou come to minnith   even  twenty cities  and unto the plain of the vineyards  with a very great slaughter  thus the children of ammon were subdued before the children of israel   
   and jephthah came to mizpeh unto his house  and  behold  his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances  and she  was his  only child  beside her he had neither son nor daughter   
   and it came to pass  when he saw her  that he rent his clothes  and said  alas  my daughter  thou hast brought me very low  and thou art one of them that trouble me  for i have opened my mouth unto the lord  and i cannot go back   
   and she said unto him  my father   if  thou hast opened thy mouth unto the lord  do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth  forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies   even  of the children of ammon   
   and she said unto her father  let this thing be done for me  let me alone two months  that i may go up and down upon the mountains  and bewail my virginity  i and my fellows   
   and he said  go  and he sent her away  for  two months  and she went with her companions  and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains   
   and it came to pass at the end of two months  that she returned unto her father  who did with her  according  to his vow which he had vowed  and she knew no man  and it was a custom in israel   
    that  the daughters of israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in a year   
judges    
   and the men of ephraim gathered themselves together  and went northward  and said unto jephthah  wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of ammon  and didst not call us to go with thee  we will burn thine house upon thee with fire   
  and jephthah said unto them  i and my people were at great strife with the children of ammon  and when i called you  ye delivered me not out of their hands   
  and when i saw that ye delivered  me  not  i put my life in my hands  and passed over against the children of ammon  and the lord delivered them into my hand  wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day  to fight against me   
  then jephthah gathered together all the men of gilead  and fought with ephraim  and the men of gilead smote ephraim  because they said  ye gileadites  are  fugitives of ephraim among the ephraimites   and  among the manassites   
  and the gileadites took the passages of jordan before the ephraimites  and it was  so   that when those ephraimites which were escaped said  let me go over  that the men of gilead said unto him   art  thou an ephraimite  if he said  nay   
  then said they unto him  say now shibboleth  and he said sibboleth  for he could not frame to pronounce  it  right  then they took him  and slew him at the passages of jordan  and there fell at that time of the ephraimites forty and two thousand   
  and jephthah judged israel six years  then died jephthah the gileadite  and was buried in  one of  the cities of gilead   
   and after him ibzan of bethlehem judged israel   
  and he had thirty sons  and thirty daughters   whom  he sent abroad  and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons  and he judged israel seven years   
   then died ibzan  and was buried at bethlehem   
   and after him elon  a zebulonite  judged israel  and he judged israel ten years   
   and elon the zebulonite died  and was buried in aijalon in the country of zebulun   
   and after him abdon the son of hillel  a pirathonite  judged israel   
   and he had forty sons and thirty nephews  that rode on threescore and ten ass colts  and he judged israel eight years   
   and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite died  and was buried in pirathon in the land of ephraim  in the mount of the amalekites   
judges    
   and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord  and the lord delivered them into the hand of the philistines forty years   
  and there was a certain man of zorah  of the family of the danites  whose name  was  manoah  and his wife  was  barren  and bare not   
  and the angel of the lord appeared unto the woman  and said unto her  behold now  thou  art  barren  and bearest not  but thou shalt conceive  and bear a son   
  now therefore beware  i pray thee  and drink not wine nor strong drink  and eat not any unclean  thing    
  for  lo  thou shalt conceive  and bear a son  and no razor shall come on his head  for the child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb  and he shall begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines   
  then the woman came and told her husband  saying  a man of god came unto me  and his countenance  was  like the countenance of an angel of god  very terrible  but i asked him not whence he  was   neither told he me his name   
  but he said unto me  behold  thou shalt conceive  and bear a son  and now drink no wine nor strong drink  neither eat any unclean  thing   for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the womb to the day of his death   
   then manoah intreated the lord  and said  o my lord  let the man of god which thou didst send come again unto us  and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born   
  and god hearkened to the voice of manoah  and the angel of god came again unto the woman as she sat in the field  but manoah her husband  was  not with her   
   and the woman made haste  and ran  and shewed her husband  and said unto him  behold  the man hath appeared unto me  that came unto me the  other  day   
   and manoah arose  and went after his wife  and came to the man  and said unto him   art  thou the man that spakest unto the woman  and he said  i  am    
   and manoah said  now let thy words come to pass  how shall we order the child  and  how  shall we do unto him   
   and the angel of the lord said unto manoah  of all that i said unto the woman let her beware   
   she may not eat of any  thing  that cometh of the vine  neither let her drink wine or strong drink  nor eat any unclean  thing   all that i commanded her let her observe   
    and manoah said unto the angel of the lord  i pray thee  let us detain thee  until we shall have made ready a kid for thee   
   and the angel of the lord said unto manoah  though thou detain me  i will not eat of thy bread  and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering  thou must offer it unto the lord  for manoah knew not that he  was  an angel of the lord   
   and manoah said unto the angel of the lord  what  is  thy name  that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour   
   and the angel of the lord said unto him  why askest thou thus after my name  seeing it  is  secret   
   so manoah took a kid with a meat offering  and offered  it  upon a rock unto the lord  and  the angel  did wondrously  and manoah and his wife looked on   
   for it came to pass  when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar  that the angel of the lord ascended in the flame of the altar  and manoah and his wife looked on  it   and fell on their faces to the ground   
   but the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoah and to his wife  then manoah knew that he  was  an angel of the lord   
   and manoah said unto his wife  we shall surely die  because we have seen god   
   but his wife said unto him  if the lord were pleased to kill us  he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands  neither would he have shewed us all these  things   nor would as at this time have told us  such things  as these   
    and the woman bare a son  and called his name samson  and the child grew  and the lord blessed him   
   and the spirit of the lord began to move him at times in the camp of dan between zorah and eshtaol   
judges    
   and samson went down to timnath  and saw a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines   
  and he came up  and told his father and his mother  and said  i have seen a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines  now therefore get her for me to wife   
  then his father and his mother said unto him   is there  never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren  or among all my people  that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistines  and samson said unto his father  get her for me  for she pleaseth me well   
  but his father and his mother knew not that it  was  of the lord  that he sought an occasion against the philistines  for at that time the philistines had dominion over israel   
  then went samson down  and his father and his mother  to timnath  and came to the vineyards of timnath  and  behold  a young lion roared against him   
  and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him  and he rent him as he would have rent a kid  and  he had  nothing in his hand  but he told not his father or his mother what he had done   
  and he went down  and talked with the woman  and she pleased samson well   
  and after a time he returned to take her  and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion  and  behold   there was  a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion   
  and he took thereof in his hands  and went on eating  and came to his father and mother  and he gave them  and they did eat  but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion   
    so his father went down unto the woman  and samson made there a feast  for so used the young men to do   
   and it came to pass  when they saw him  that they brought thirty companions to be with him   
   and samson said unto them  i will now put forth a riddle unto you  if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast  and find  it  out  then i will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments   
   but if ye cannot declare  it  me  then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments  and they said unto him  put forth thy riddle  that we may hear it   
   and he said unto them  out of the eater came forth meat  and out of the strong came forth sweetness  and they could not in three days expound the riddle   
   and it came to pass on the seventh day  that they said unto samson s wife  entice thy husband  that he may declare unto us the riddle  lest we burn thee and thy father s house with fire  have ye called us to take that we have   is it  not  so    
   and samson s wife wept before him  and said  thou dost but hate me  and lovest me not  thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people  and hast not told  it  me  and he said unto her  behold  i have not told  it  my father nor my mother  and shall i tell  it  thee   
   and she wept before him the seven days  while their feast lasted  and it came to pass on the seventh day  that he told her  because she lay sore upon him  and she told the riddle to the children of her people   
   and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down  what  is  sweeter than honey  and what  is  stronger than a lion  and he said unto them  if ye had not plowed with my heifer  ye had not found out my riddle   
   and the spirit of the lord came upon him  and he went down to ashkelon  and slew thirty men of them  and took their spoil  and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle  and his anger was kindled  and he went up to his father s house   
   but samson s wife was  given  to his companion  whom he had used as his friend   
judges    
   but it came to pass within a while after  in the time of wheat harvest  that samson visited his wife with a kid  and he said  i will go in to my wife into the chamber  but her father would not suffer him to go in   
  and her father said  i verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her  therefore i gave her to thy companion   is  not her younger sister fairer than she  take her  i pray thee  instead of her   
  and samson said concerning them  now shall i be more blameless than the philistines  though i do them a displeasure   
  and samson went and caught three hundred foxes  and took firebrands  and turned tail to tail  and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails   
  and when he had set the brands on fire  he let  them  go into the standing corn of the philistines  and burnt up both the shocks  and also the standing corn  with the vineyards  and  olives   
  then the philistines said  who hath done this  and they answered  samson  the son in law of the timnite  because he had taken his wife  and given her to his companion  and the philistines came up  and burnt her and her father with fire   
  and samson said unto them  though ye have done this  yet will i be avenged of you  and after that i will cease   
  and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter  and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock etam   
   then the philistines went up  and pitched in judah  and spread themselves in lehi   
   and the men of judah said  why are ye come up against us  and they answered  to bind samson are we come up  to do to him as he hath done to us   
   then three thousand men of judah went to the top of the rock etam  and said to samson  knowest thou not that the philistines  are  rulers over us  what  is  this  that  thou hast done unto us  and he said unto them  as they did unto me  so have i done unto them   
   and they said unto him  we are come down to bind thee  that we may deliver thee into the hand of the philistines  and samson said unto them  swear unto me  that ye will not fall upon me yourselves   
   and they spake unto him  saying  no  but we will bind thee fast  and deliver thee into their hand  but surely we will not kill thee  and they bound him with two new cords  and brought him up from the rock   
    and  when he came unto lehi  the philistines shouted against him  and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him  and the cords that  were  upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire  and his bands loosed from off his hands   
   and he found a new jawbone of an ass  and put forth his hand  and took it  and slew a thousand men therewith   
   and samson said  with the jawbone of an ass  heaps upon heaps  with the jaw of an ass have i slain a thousand men   
   and it came to pass  when he had made an end of speaking  that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand  and called that place ramathlehi   
    and he was sore athirst  and called on the lord  and said  thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant  and now shall i die for thirst  and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised   
   but god clave an hollow place that  was  in the jaw  and there came water thereout  and when he had drunk  his spirit came again  and he revived  wherefore he called the name thereof enhakkore  which  is  in lehi unto this day   
   and he judged israel in the days of the philistines twenty years   
judges    
   then went samson to gaza  and saw there an harlot  and went in unto her   
   and it was told  the gazites  saying  samson is come hither  and they compassed  him  in  and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city  and were quiet all the night  saying  in the morning  when it is day  we shall kill him   
  and samson lay till midnight  and arose at midnight  and took the doors of the gate of the city  and the two posts  and went away with them  bar and all  and put  them  upon his shoulders  and carried them up to the top of an hill that  is  before hebron   
   and it came to pass afterward  that he loved a woman in the valley of sorek  whose name  was  delilah   
  and the lords of the philistines came up unto her  and said unto her  entice him  and see wherein his great strength  lieth   and by what  means  we may prevail against him  that we may bind him to afflict him  and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred  pieces  of silver   
  and delilah said to samson  tell me  i pray thee  wherein thy great strength  lieth   and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee   
  and samson said unto her  if they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried  then shall i be weak  and be as another man   
  then the lords of the philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried  and she bound him with them   
  now  there were  men lying in wait  abiding with her in the chamber  and she said unto him  the philistines  be  upon thee  samson  and he brake the withs  as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire  so his strength was not known   
   and delilah said unto samson  behold  thou hast mocked me  and told me lies  now tell me  i pray thee  wherewith thou mightest be bound   
   and he said unto her  if they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied  then shall i be weak  and be as another man   
   delilah therefore took new ropes  and bound him therewith  and said unto him  the philistines  be  upon thee  samson  and  there were  liers in wait abiding in the chamber  and he brake them from off his arms like a thread   
   and delilah said unto samson  hitherto thou hast mocked me  and told me lies  tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound  and he said unto her  if thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web   
   and she fastened  it  with the pin  and said unto him  the philistines  be  upon thee  samson  and he awaked out of his sleep  and went away with the pin of the beam  and with the web   
   and she said unto him  how canst thou say  i love thee  when thine heart  is  not with me  thou hast mocked me these three times  and hast not told me wherein thy great strength  lieth    
   and it came to pass  when she pressed him daily with her words  and urged him   so  that his soul was vexed unto death   
   that he told her all his heart  and said unto her  there hath not come a razor upon mine head  for i  have been  a nazarite unto god from my mother s womb  if i be shaven  then my strength will go from me  and i shall become weak  and be like any  other  man   
    and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart  she sent and called for the lords of the philistines  saying  come up this once  for he hath shewed me all his heart  then the lords of the philistines came up unto her  and brought money in their hand   
   and she made him sleep upon her knees  and she called for a man  and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head  and she began to afflict him  and his strength went from him   
   and she said  the philistines  be  upon thee  samson  and he awoke out of his sleep  and said  i will go out as at other times before  and shake myself  and he wist not that the lord was departed from him   
   but the philistines took him  and put out his eyes  and brought him down to gaza  and bound him with fetters of brass  and he did grind in the prison house   
    howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven   
   then the lords of the philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto dagon their god  and to rejoice  for they said  our god hath delivered samson our enemy into our hand   
   and when the people saw him  they praised their god  for they said  our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy  and the destroyer of our country  which slew many of us   
   and it came to pass  when their hearts were merry  that they said  call for samson  that he may make us sport  and they called for samson out of the prison house  and he made them sport  and they set him between the pillars   
   and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand  suffer me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth  that i may lean upon them   
   now the house was full of men and women  and all the lords of the philistines  were  there  and  there were  upon the roof about three thousand men and women  that beheld while samson made sport   
   and samson called unto the lord  and said  o lord god  remember me  i pray thee  and strengthen me  i pray thee  only this once  o god  that i may be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes   
   and samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood  and on which it was borne up  of the one with his right hand  and of the other with his left   
   and samson said  let me die with the philistines  and he bowed himself with  all his  might  and the house fell upon the lords  and upon all the people that  were  therein  so the dead which he slew at his death were more than  they  which he slew in his life   
   then his brethren and all the house of his father came down  and took him  and brought  him  up  and buried him between zorah and eshtaol in the buryingplace of manoah his father  and he judged israel twenty years   
judges    
   and there was a man of mount ephraim  whose name  was  micah   
  and he said unto his mother  the eleven hundred  shekels  of silver that were taken from thee  about which thou cursedst  and spakest of also in mine ears  behold  the silver  is  with me  i took it  and his mother said  blessed  be thou  of the lord  my son   
  and when he had restored the eleven hundred  shekels  of silver to his mother  his mother said  i had wholly dedicated the silver unto the lord from my hand for my son  to make a graven image and a molten image  now therefore i will restore it unto thee   
  yet he restored the money unto his mother  and his mother took two hundred  shekels  of silver  and gave them to the founder  who made thereof a graven image and a molten image  and they were in the house of micah   
  and the man micah had an house of gods  and made an ephod  and teraphim  and consecrated one of his sons  who became his priest   
  in those days  there was  no king in israel   but  every man did  that which was  right in his own eyes   
   and there was a young man out of bethlehemjudah of the family of judah  who  was  a levite  and he sojourned there   
  and the man departed out of the city from bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find  a place   and he came to mount ephraim to the house of micah  as he journeyed   
  and micah said unto him  whence comest thou  and he said unto him  i  am  a levite of bethlehemjudah  and i go to sojourn where i may find  a place    
   and micah said unto him  dwell with me  and be unto me a father and a priest  and i will give thee ten  shekels  of silver by the year  and a suit of apparel  and thy victuals  so the levite went in   
   and the levite was content to dwell with the man  and the young man was unto him as one of his sons   
   and micah consecrated the levite  and the young man became his priest  and was in the house of micah   
   then said micah  now know i that the lord will do me good  seeing i have a levite to  my  priest   
judges    
   in those days  there was  no king in israel  and in those days the tribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in  for unto that day  all their  inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of israel   
  and the children of dan sent of their family five men from their coasts  men of valour  from zorah  and from eshtaol  to spy out the land  and to search it  and they said unto them  go  search the land  who when they came to mount ephraim  to the house of micah  they lodged there   
  when they  were  by the house of micah  they knew the voice of the young man the levite  and they turned in thither  and said unto him  who brought thee hither  and what makest thou in this  place   and what hast thou here   
  and he said unto them  thus and thus dealeth micah with me  and hath hired me  and i am his priest   
  and they said unto him  ask counsel  we pray thee  of god  that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous   
  and the priest said unto them  go in peace  before the lord  is  your way wherein ye go   
   then the five men departed  and came to laish  and saw the people that  were  therein  how they dwelt careless  after the manner of the zidonians  quiet and secure  and  there was  no magistrate in the land  that might put  them  to shame in  any  thing  and they  were  far from the zidonians  and had no business with  any  man   
  and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol  and their brethren said unto them  what  say  ye   
  and they said  arise  that we may go up against them  for we have seen the land  and  behold  it  is  very good  and  are  ye still  be not slothful to go   and  to enter to possess the land   
   when ye go  ye shall come unto a people secure  and to a large land  for god hath given it into your hands  a place where  there is  no want of any thing that  is  in the earth   
   and there went from thence of the family of the danites  out of zorah and out of eshtaol  six hundred men appointed with weapons of war   
   and they went up  and pitched in kirjathjearim  in judah  wherefore they called that place mahanehdan unto this day  behold   it is  behind kirjathjearim   
   and they passed thence unto mount ephraim  and came unto the house of micah   
    then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of laish  and said unto their brethren  do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod  and teraphim  and a graven image  and a molten image  now therefore consider what ye have to do   
   and they turned thitherward  and came to the house of the young man the levite   even  unto the house of micah  and saluted him   
   and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war  which  were  of the children of dan  stood by the entering of the gate   
   and the five men that went to spy out the land went up   and  came in thither   and  took the graven image  and the ephod  and the teraphim  and the molten image  and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men  that were  appointed with weapons of war   
   and these went into micah s house  and fetched the carved image  the ephod  and the teraphim  and the molten image  then said the priest unto them  what do ye   
   and they said unto him  hold thy peace  lay thine hand upon thy mouth  and go with us  and be to us a father and a priest   is it  better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man  or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in israel   
   and the priest s heart was glad  and he took the ephod  and the teraphim  and the graven image  and went in the midst of the people   
   so they turned and departed  and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them   
    and  when they were a good way from the house of micah  the men that  were  in the houses near to micah s house were gathered together  and overtook the children of dan   
   and they cried unto the children of dan  and they turned their faces  and said unto micah  what aileth thee  that thou comest with such a company   
   and he said  ye have taken away my gods which i made  and the priest  and ye are gone away  and what have i more  and what  is  this  that  ye say unto me  what aileth thee   
   and the children of dan said unto him  let not thy voice be heard among us  lest angry fellows run upon thee  and thou lose thy life  with the lives of thy household   
   and the children of dan went their way  and when micah saw that they  were  too strong for him  he turned and went back unto his house   
    and they took  the things  which micah had made  and the priest which he had  and came unto laish  unto a people  that were  at quiet and secure  and they smote them with the edge of the sword  and burnt the city with fire   
   and  there was  no deliverer  because it  was  far from zidon  and they had no business with  any  man  and it was in the valley that  lieth  by bethrehob  and they built a city  and dwelt therein   
   and they called the name of the city dan  after the name of dan their father  who was born unto israel  howbeit the name of the city  was  laish at the first   
   and the children of dan set up the graven image  and jonathan  the son of gershom  the son of manasseh  he and his sons were priests to the tribe of dan until the day of the captivity of the land   
   and they set them up micah s graven image  which he made  all the time that the house of god was in shiloh   
judges    
   and it came to pass in those days  when  there was  no king in israel  that there was a certain levite sojourning on the side of mount ephraim  who took to him a concubine out of bethlehemjudah   
  and his concubine played the whore against him  and went away from him unto her father s house to bethlehemjudah  and was there four whole months   
  and her husband arose  and went after her  to speak friendly unto her   and  to bring her again  having his servant with him  and a couple of asses  and she brought him into her father s house  and when the father of the damsel saw him  he rejoiced to meet him   
  and his father in law  the damsel s father  retained him  and he abode with him three days  so they did eat and drink  and lodged there   
  and it came to pass on the fourth day  when they arose early in the morning  that he rose up to depart  and the damsel s father said unto his son in law  comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread  and afterward go your way   
  and they sat down  and did eat and drink both of them together  for the damsel s father had said unto the man  be content  i pray thee  and tarry all night  and let thine heart be merry   
  and when the man rose up to depart  his father in law urged him  therefore he lodged there again   
  and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart  and the damsel s father said  comfort thine heart  i pray thee  and they tarried until afternoon  and they did eat both of them   
  and when the man rose up to depart  he  and his concubine  and his servant  his father in law  the damsel s father  said unto him  behold  now the day draweth toward evening  i pray you tarry all night  behold  the day groweth to an end  lodge here  that thine heart may be merry  and to morrow get you early on your way  that thou mayest go home   
   but the man would not tarry that night  but he rose up and departed  and came over against jebus  which  is  jerusalem  and  there were  with him two asses saddled  his concubine also  was  with him   
    and  when they  were  by jebus  the day was far spent  and the servant said unto his master  come  i pray thee  and let us turn in into this city of the jebusites  and lodge in it   
   and his master said unto him  we will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger  that  is  not of the children of israel  we will pass over to gibeah   
   and he said unto his servant  come  and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night  in gibeah  or in ramah   
   and they passed on and went their way  and the sun went down upon them  when they were  by gibeah  which  belongeth  to benjamin   
   and they turned aside thither  to go in  and  to lodge in gibeah  and when he went in  he sat him down in a street of the city  for  there was  no man that took them into his house to lodging   
    and  behold  there came an old man from his work out of the field at even  which  was  also of mount ephraim  and he sojourned in gibeah  but the men of the place  were  benjamites   
   and when he had lifted up his eyes  he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city  and the old man said  whither goest thou  and whence comest thou   
   and he said unto him  we  are  passing from bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount ephraim  from thence  am  i  and i went to bethlehemjudah  but i  am now  going to the house of the lord  and there  is  no man that receiveth me to house   
   yet there is both straw and provender for our asses  and there is bread and wine also for me  and for thy handmaid  and for the young man  which is  with thy servants   there is  no want of any thing   
   and the old man said  peace  be  with thee  howsoever  let  all thy wants  lie  upon me  only lodge not in the street   
   so he brought him into his house  and gave provender unto the asses  and they washed their feet  and did eat and drink   
     now  as they were making their hearts merry  behold  the men of the city  certain sons of belial  beset the house round about   and  beat at the door  and spake to the master of the house  the old man  saying  bring forth the man that came into thine house  that we may know him   
   and the man  the master of the house  went out unto them  and said unto them  nay  my brethren   nay   i pray you  do not  so  wickedly  seeing that this man is come into mine house  do not this folly   
   behold   here is  my daughter a maiden  and his concubine  them i will bring out now  and humble ye them  and do with them what seemeth good unto you  but unto this man do not so vile a thing   
   but the men would not hearken to him  so the man took his concubine  and brought her forth unto them  and they knew her  and abused her all the night until the morning  and when the day began to spring  they let her go   
   then came the woman in the dawning of the day  and fell down at the door of the man s house where her lord  was   till it was light   
   and her lord rose up in the morning  and opened the doors of the house  and went out to go his way  and  behold  the woman his concubine was fallen down  at  the door of the house  and her hands  were  upon the threshold   
   and he said unto her  up  and let us be going  but none answered  then the man took her  up  upon an ass  and the man rose up  and gat him unto his place   
   and when he was come into his house  he took a knife  and laid hold on his concubine  and divided her   together  with her bones  into twelve pieces  and sent her into all the coasts of israel   
   and it was so  that all that saw it said  there was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of israel came up out of the land of egypt unto this day  consider of it  take advice  and speak  your minds    
judges    
   then all the children of israel went out  and the congregation was gathered together as one man  from dan even to beersheba  with the land of gilead  unto the lord in mizpeh   
  and the chief of all the people   even  of all the tribes of israel  presented themselves in the assembly of the people of god  four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword   
   now the children of benjamin heard that the children of israel were gone up to mizpeh   then said the children of israel  tell  us   how was this wickedness   
  and the levite  the husband of the woman that was slain  answered and said  i came into gibeah that  belongeth  to benjamin  i and my concubine  to lodge   
  and the men of gibeah rose against me  and beset the house round about upon me by night   and  thought to have slain me  and my concubine have they forced  that she is dead   
  and i took my concubine  and cut her in pieces  and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of israel  for they have committed lewdness and folly in israel   
  behold  ye  are  all children of israel  give here your advice and counsel   
  and all the people arose as one man  saying  we will not any  of us  go to his tent  neither will we any  of us  turn into his house   
  but now this  shall be  the thing which we will do to gibeah   we will go up  by lot against it   
   and we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of israel  and an hundred of a thousand  and a thousand out of ten thousand  to fetch victual for the people  that they may do  when they come to gibeah of benjamin  according to all the folly that they have wrought in israel   
   so all the men of israel were gathered against the city  knit together as one man   
    and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of benjamin  saying  what wickedness  is  this that is done among you   
   now therefore deliver  us  the men  the children of belial  which  are  in gibeah  that we may put them to death  and put away evil from israel  but the children of benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of israel   
   but the children of benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto gibeah  to go out to battle against the children of israel   
   and the children of benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword  beside the inhabitants of gibeah  which were numbered seven hundred chosen men   
   among all this people  there were  seven hundred chosen men lefthanded  every one could sling stones at an hair  breadth   and not miss   
   and the men of israel  beside benjamin  were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword  all these  were  men of war   
    and the children of israel arose  and went up to the house of god  and asked counsel of god  and said  which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of benjamin  and the lord said  judah  shall go up  first   
   and the children of israel rose up in the morning  and encamped against gibeah   
   and the men of israel went out to battle against benjamin  and the men of israel put themselves in array to fight against them at gibeah   
   and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah  and destroyed down to the ground of the israelites that day twenty and two thousand men   
   and the people the men of israel encouraged themselves  and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day   
    and the children of israel went up and wept before the lord until even  and asked counsel of the lord  saying  shall i go up again to battle against the children of benjamin my brother  and the lord said  go up against him    
   and the children of israel came near against the children of benjamin the second day   
   and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the second day  and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel again eighteen thousand men  all these drew the sword   
    then all the children of israel  and all the people  went up  and came unto the house of god  and wept  and sat there before the lord  and fasted that day until even  and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord   
   and the children of israel enquired of the lord   for the ark of the covenant of god  was  there in those days   
   and phinehas  the son of eleazar  the son of aaron  stood before it in those days   saying  shall i yet again go out to battle against the children of benjamin my brother  or shall i cease  and the lord said  go up  for to morrow i will deliver them into thine hand   
   and israel set liers in wait round about gibeah   
   and the children of israel went up against the children of benjamin on the third day  and put themselves in array against gibeah  as at other times   
   and the children of benjamin went out against the people   and  were drawn away from the city  and they began to smite of the people   and  kill  as at other times  in the highways  of which one goeth up to the house of god  and the other to gibeah in the field  about thirty men of israel   
   and the children of benjamin said  they  are  smitten down before us  as at the first  but the children of israel said  let us flee  and draw them from the city unto the highways   
   and all the men of israel rose up out of their place  and put themselves in array at baaltamar  and the liers in wait of israel came forth out of their places   even  out of the meadows of gibeah   
   and there came against gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all israel  and the battle was sore  but they knew not that evil  was  near them   
   and the lord smote benjamin before israel  and the children of israel destroyed of the benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men  all these drew the sword   
   so the children of benjamin saw that they were smitten  for the men of israel gave place to the benjamites  because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside gibeah   
   and the liers in wait hasted  and rushed upon gibeah  and the liers in wait drew  themselves  along  and smote all the city with the edge of the sword   
   now there was an appointed sign between the men of israel and the liers in wait  that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city   
   and when the men of israel retired in the battle  benjamin began to smite  and  kill of the men of israel about thirty persons  for they said  surely they are smitten down before us  as  in  the first battle   
   but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke  the benjamites looked behind them  and  behold  the flame of the city ascended up to heaven   
   and when the men of israel turned again  the men of benjamin were amazed  for they saw that evil was come upon them   
   therefore they turned  their backs  before the men of israel unto the way of the wilderness  but the battle overtook them  and them which  came  out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them   
    thus  they inclosed the benjamites round about   and  chased them   and  trode them down with ease over against gibeah toward the sunrising   
   and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men  all these  were  men of valour   
   and they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of rimmon  and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men  and pursued hard after them unto gidom  and slew two thousand men of them   
   so that all which fell that day of benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword  all these  were  men of valour   
   but six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock rimmon  and abode in the rock rimmon four months   
   and the men of israel turned again upon the children of benjamin  and smote them with the edge of the sword  as well the men of  every  city  as the beast  and all that came to hand  also they set on fire all the cities that they came to   
judges    
   now the men of israel had sworn in mizpeh  saying  there shall not any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife   
  and the people came to the house of god  and abode there till even before god  and lifted up their voices  and wept sore   
  and said  o lord god of israel  why is this come to pass in israel  that there should be to day one tribe lacking in israel   
  and it came to pass on the morrow  that the people rose early  and built there an altar  and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings   
  and the children of israel said  who  is there  among all the tribes of israel that came not up with the congregation unto the lord  for they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the lord to mizpeh  saying  he shall surely be put to death   
  and the children of israel repented them for benjamin their brother  and said  there is one tribe cut off from israel this day   
  how shall we do for wives for them that remain  seeing we have sworn by the lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives   
  and they said  what one  is there  of the tribes of israel that came not up to mizpeh to the lord  and  behold  there came none to the camp from jabeshgilead to the assembly   
  for the people were numbered  and  behold   there were  none of the inhabitants of jabeshgilead there   
   and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest  and commanded them  saying  go and smite the inhabitants of jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword  with the women and the children   
   and this  is  the thing that ye shall do  ye shall utterly destroy every male  and every woman that hath lain by man   
   and they found among the inhabitants of jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins  that had known no man by lying with any male  and they brought them unto the camp to shiloh  which  is  in the land of canaan   
   and the whole congregation sent  some  to speak to the children of benjamin that  were  in the rock rimmon  and to call peaceably unto them   
   and benjamin came again at that time  and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of jabeshgilead  and yet so they sufficed them not   
   and the people repented them for benjamin  because that the lord had made a breach in the tribes of israel   
    then the elders of the congregation said  how shall we do for wives for them that remain  seeing the women are destroyed out of benjamin   
   and they said   there must be  an inheritance for them that be escaped of benjamin  that a tribe be not destroyed out of israel   
   howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters  for the children of israel have sworn  saying  cursed  be  he that giveth a wife to benjamin   
   then they said  behold   there is  a feast of the lord in shiloh yearly  in a place  which  is  on the north side of bethel  on the east side of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem  and on the south of lebonah   
   therefore they commanded the children of benjamin  saying  go and lie in wait in the vineyards   
   and see  and  behold  if the daughters of shiloh come out to dance in dances  then come ye out of the vineyards  and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of shiloh  and go to the land of benjamin   
   and it shall be  when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain  that we will say unto them  be favourable unto them for our sakes  because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war  for ye did not give unto them at this time   that  ye should be guilty   
   and the children of benjamin did so  and took  them  wives  according to their number  of them that danced  whom they caught  and they went and returned unto their inheritance  and repaired the cities  and dwelt in them   
   and the children of israel departed thence at that time  every man to his tribe and to his family  and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance   
   in those days  there was  no king in israel  every man did  that which was  right in his own eyes   
 
ruth 
ruth   
   now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled  that there was a famine in the land  and a certain man of bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of moab  he  and his wife  and his two sons   
  and the name of the man  was  elimelech  and the name of his wife naomi  and the name of his two sons mahlon and chilion  ephrathites of bethlehemjudah  and they came into the country of moab  and continued there   
  and elimelech naomi s husband died  and she was left  and her two sons   
  and they took them wives of the women of moab  the name of the one  was  orpah  and the name of the other ruth  and they dwelled there about ten years   
  and mahlon and chilion died also both of them  and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband   
   then she arose with her daughters in law  that she might return from the country of moab  for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread   
  wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was  and her two daughters in law with her  and they went on the way to return unto the land of judah   
  and naomi said unto her two daughters in law  go  return each to her mother s house  the lord deal kindly with you  as ye have dealt with the dead  and with me   
  the lord grant you that ye may find rest  each  of you  in the house of her husband  then she kissed them  and they lifted up their voice  and wept   
   and they said unto her  surely we will return with thee unto thy people   
   and naomi said  turn again  my daughters  why will ye go with me   are  there yet  any more  sons in my womb  that they may be your husbands   
   turn again  my daughters  go  your way   for i am too old to have an husband  if i should say  i have hope   if  i should have an husband also to night  and should also bear sons   
   would ye tarry for them till they were grown  would ye stay for them from having husbands  nay  my daughters  for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord is gone out against me   
   and they lifted up their voice  and wept again  and orpah kissed her mother in law  but ruth clave unto her   
   and she said  behold  thy sister in law is gone back unto her people  and unto her gods  return thou after thy sister in law   
   and ruth said  intreat me not to leave thee   or  to return from following after thee  for whither thou goest  i will go  and where thou lodgest  i will lodge  thy people  shall be  my people  and thy god my god   
   where thou diest  will i die  and there will i be buried  the lord do so to me  and more also   if ought  but death part thee and me   
   when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her  then she left speaking unto her   
    so they two went until they came to bethlehem  and it came to pass  when they were come to bethlehem  that all the city was moved about them  and they said   is  this naomi   
   and she said unto them  call me not naomi  call me mara  for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me   
   i went out full  and the lord hath brought me home again empty  why  then  call ye me naomi  seeing the lord hath testified against me  and the almighty hath afflicted me   
   so naomi returned  and ruth the moabitess  her daughter in law  with her  which returned out of the country of moab  and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest   
ruth   
   and naomi had a kinsman of her husband s  a mighty man of wealth  of the family of elimelech  and his name  was  boaz   
  and ruth the moabitess said unto naomi  let me now go to the field  and glean ears of corn after  him  in whose sight i shall find grace  and she said unto her  go  my daughter   
  and she went  and came  and gleaned in the field after the reapers  and her hap was to light on a part of the field  belonging  unto boaz  who  was  of the kindred of elimelech   
   and  behold  boaz came from bethlehem  and said unto the reapers  the lord  be  with you  and they answered him  the lord bless thee   
  then said boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers  whose damsel  is  this   
  and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said  it  is  the moabitish damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab   
  and she said  i pray you  let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves  so she came  and hath continued even from the morning until now  that she tarried a little in the house   
  then said boaz unto ruth  hearest thou not  my daughter  go not to glean in another field  neither go from hence  but abide here fast by my maidens   
   let  thine eyes  be  on the field that they do reap  and go thou after them  have i not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee  and when thou art athirst  go unto the vessels  and drink of  that  which the young men have drawn   
   then she fell on her face  and bowed herself to the ground  and said unto him  why have i found grace in thine eyes  that thou shouldest take knowledge of me  seeing i  am  a stranger   
   and boaz answered and said unto her  it hath fully been shewed me  all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband  and  how  thou hast left thy father and thy mother  and the land of thy nativity  and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore   
   the lord recompense thy work  and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel  under whose wings thou art come to trust   
   then she said  let me find favour in thy sight  my lord  for that thou hast comforted me  and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid  though i be not like unto one of thine handmaidens   
   and boaz said unto her  at mealtime come thou hither  and eat of the bread  and dip thy morsel in the vinegar  and she sat beside the reapers  and he reached her parched  corn   and she did eat  and was sufficed  and left   
   and when she was risen up to glean  boaz commanded his young men  saying  let her glean even among the sheaves  and reproach her not   
   and let fall also  some  of the handfuls of purpose for her  and leave  them   that she may glean  them   and rebuke her not   
    so she gleaned in the field until even  and beat out that she had gleaned  and it was about an ephah of barley   
   and she took  it  up  and went into the city  and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned  and she brought forth  and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed   
   and her mother in law said unto her  where hast thou gleaned to day  and where wroughtest thou  blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee  and she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought  and said  the man s name with whom i wrought to day  is  boaz   
   and naomi said unto her daughter in law  blessed  be  he of the lord  who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead  and naomi said unto her  the man  is  near of kin unto us  one of our next kinsmen   
   and ruth the moabitess said  he said unto me also  thou shalt keep fast by my young men  until they have ended all my harvest   
   and naomi said unto ruth her daughter in law   it is  good  my daughter  that thou go out with his maidens  that they meet thee not in any other field   
   so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest  and dwelt with her mother in law   
ruth   
   then naomi her mother in law said unto her  my daughter  shall i not seek rest for thee  that it may be well with thee   
  and now  is  not boaz of our kindred  with whose maidens thou wast  behold  he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor   
  wash thyself therefore  and anoint thee  and put thy raiment upon thee  and get thee down to the floor   but  make not thyself known unto the man  until he shall have done eating and drinking   
  and it shall be  when he lieth down  that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie  and thou shalt go in  and uncover his feet  and lay thee down  and he will tell thee what thou shalt do   
  and she said unto her  all that thou sayest unto me i will do   
   and she went down unto the floor  and did according to all that her mother in law bade her   
  and when boaz had eaten and drunk  and his heart was merry  he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn  and she came softly  and uncovered his feet  and laid her down   
  and it came to pass at midnight  that the man was afraid  and turned himself  and  behold  a woman lay at his feet   
  and he said  who  art  thou  and she answered  i  am  ruth thine handmaid  spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid  for thou  art  a near kinsman   
   and he said  blessed  be  thou of the lord  my daughter   for  thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning  inasmuch as thou followedst not young men  whether poor or rich   
   and now  my daughter  fear not  i will do to thee all that thou requirest  for all the city of my people doth know that thou  art  a virtuous woman   
   and now it is true that i  am thy  near kinsman  howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than i   
   tarry this night  and it shall be in the morning   that  if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman  well  let him do the kinsman s part  but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee  then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee   as  the lord liveth  lie down until the morning   
    and she lay at his feet until the morning  and she rose up before one could know another  and he said  let it not be known that a woman came into the floor   
   also he said  bring the vail that  thou hast  upon thee  and hold it  and when she held it  he measured six  measures  of barley  and laid  it  on her  and she went into the city   
   and when she came to her mother in law  she said  who  art  thou  my daughter  and she told her all that the man had done to her   
   and she said  these six  measures  of barley gave he me  for he said to me  go not empty unto thy mother in law   
   then said she  sit still  my daughter  until thou know how the matter will fall  for the man will not be in rest  until he have finished the thing this day   
ruth   
   then went boaz up to the gate  and sat him down there  and  behold  the kinsman of whom boaz spake came by  unto whom he said  ho  such a one  turn aside  sit down here  and he turned aside  and sat down   
  and he took ten men of the elders of the city  and said  sit ye down here  and they sat down   
  and he said unto the kinsman  naomi  that is come again out of the country of moab  selleth a parcel of land  which  was  our brother elimelech s   
  and i thought to advertise thee  saying  buy  it  before the inhabitants  and before the elders of my people  if thou wilt redeem  it   redeem  it   but if thou wilt not redeem  it  then  tell me  that i may know  for  there is  none to redeem  it  beside thee  and i  am  after thee  and he said  i will redeem  it    
  then said boaz  what day thou buyest the field of the hand of naomi  thou must buy  it  also of ruth the moabitess  the wife of the dead  to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance   
  and the kinsman said  i cannot redeem  it  for myself  lest i mar mine own inheritance  redeem thou my right to thyself  for i cannot redeem  it    
  now this  was the manner  in former time in israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing  for to confirm all things  a man plucked off his shoe  and gave  it  to his neighbour  and this  was  a testimony in israel   
  therefore the kinsman said unto boaz  buy  it  for thee  so he drew off his shoe   
   and boaz said unto the elders  and  unto  all the people  ye  are  witnesses this day  that i have bought all that  was  elimelech s  and all that  was  chilion s and mahlon s  of the hand of naomi   
   moreover ruth the moabitess  the wife of mahlon  have i purchased to be my wife  to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance  that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren  and from the gate of his place  ye  are  witnesses this day   
   and all the people that  were  in the gate  and the elders  said   we are  witnesses  the lord make the woman that is come into thine house like rachel and like leah  which two did build the house of israel  and do thou worthily in ephratah  and be famous in bethlehem   
   and let thy house be like the house of pharez  whom tamar bare unto judah  of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young woman   
    so boaz took ruth  and she was his wife  and when he went in unto her  the lord gave her conception  and she bare a son   
   and the women said unto naomi  blessed  be  the lord  which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman  that his name may be famous in israel   
   and he shall be unto thee a restorer of  thy  life  and a nourisher of thine old age  for thy daughter in law  which loveth thee  which is better to thee than seven sons  hath born him   
   and naomi took the child  and laid it in her bosom  and became nurse unto it   
   and the women her neighbours gave it a name  saying  there is a son born to naomi  and they called his name obed  he  is  the father of jesse  the father of david   
   now these  are  the generations of pharez  pharez begat hezron   
   and hezron begat ram  and ram begat amminadab   
   and amminadab begat nahshon  and nahshon begat salmon   
   and salmon begat boaz  and boaz begat obed   
   and obed begat jesse  and jesse begat david   
 
  samuel 
  samuel   
   now there was a certain man of ramathaimzophim  of mount ephraim  and his name  was  elkanah  the son of jeroham  the son of elihu  the son of tohu  the son of zuph  an ephrathite   
  and he had two wives  the name of the one  was  hannah  and the name of the other peninnah  and peninnah had children  but hannah had no children   
  and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the lord of hosts in shiloh  and the two sons of eli  hophni and phinehas  the priests of the lord   were  there   
  and when the time was that elkanah offered  he gave to peninnah his wife  and to all her sons and her daughters  portions   
  but unto hannah he gave a worthy portion  for he loved hannah  but the lord had shut up her womb   
  and her adversary also provoked her sore  for to make her fret  because the lord had shut up her womb   
  and  as  he did so year by year  when she went up to the house of the lord  so she provoked her  therefore she wept  and did not eat   
  then said elkanah her husband to her  hannah  why weepest thou  and why eatest thou not  and why is thy heart grieved   am  not i better to thee than ten sons   
   so hannah rose up after they had eaten in shiloh  and after they had drunk  now eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the lord   
   and she  was  in bitterness of soul  and prayed unto the lord  and wept sore   
   and she vowed a vow  and said  o lord of hosts  if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid  and remember me  and not forget thine handmaid  but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child  then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life  and there shall no razor come upon his head   
   and it came to pass  as she continued praying before the lord  that eli marked her mouth   
   now hannah  she spake in her heart  only her lips moved  but her voice was not heard  therefore eli thought she had been drunken   
   and eli said unto her  how long wilt thou be drunken  put away thy wine from thee   
   and hannah answered and said  no  my lord  i  am  a woman of a sorrowful spirit  i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink  but have poured out my soul before the lord   
   count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial  for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have i spoken hitherto   
   then eli answered and said  go in peace  and the god of israel grant  thee  thy petition that thou hast asked of him   
   and she said  let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight  so the woman went her way  and did eat  and her countenance was no more  sad    
    and they rose up in the morning early  and worshipped before the lord  and returned  and came to their house to ramah  and elkanah knew hannah his wife  and the lord remembered her   
   wherefore it came to pass  when the time was come about after hannah had conceived  that she bare a son  and called his name samuel   saying   because i have asked him of the lord   
   and the man elkanah  and all his house  went up to offer unto the lord the yearly sacrifice  and his vow   
   but hannah went not up  for she said unto her husband   i will not go up  until the child be weaned  and  then  i will bring him  that he may appear before the lord  and there abide for ever   
   and elkanah her husband said unto her  do what seemeth thee good  tarry until thou have weaned him  only the lord establish his word  so the woman abode  and gave her son suck until she weaned him   
   and when she had weaned him  she took him up with her  with three bullocks  and one ephah of flour  and a bottle of wine  and brought him unto the house of the lord in shiloh  and the child  was  young   
   and they slew a bullock  and brought the child to eli   
   and she said  oh my lord   as  thy soul liveth  my lord  i  am  the woman that stood by thee here  praying unto the lord   
   for this child i prayed  and the lord hath given me my petition which i asked of him   
   therefore also i have lent him to the lord  as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the lord  and he worshipped the lord there   
  samuel   
   and hannah prayed  and said  my heart rejoiceth in the lord  mine horn is exalted in the lord  my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies  because i rejoice in thy salvation   
   there is  none holy as the lord  for  there is  none beside thee  neither  is there  any rock like our god   
  talk no more so exceeding proudly  let  not  arrogancy come out of your mouth  for the lord  is  a god of knowledge  and by him actions are weighed   
  the bows of the mighty men  are  broken  and they that stumbled are girded with strength   
   they that were  full have hired out themselves for bread  and  they that were  hungry ceased  so that the barren hath born seven  and she that hath many children is waxed feeble   
  the lord killeth  and maketh alive  he bringeth down to the grave  and bringeth up   
  the lord maketh poor  and maketh rich  he bringeth low  and lifteth up   
  he raiseth up the poor out of the dust   and  lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill  to set  them  among princes  and to make them inherit the throne of glory  for the pillars of the earth  are  the lord s  and he hath set the world upon them   
  he will keep the feet of his saints  and the wicked shall be silent in darkness  for by strength shall no man prevail   
   the adversaries of the lord shall be broken to pieces  out of heaven shall he thunder upon them  the lord shall judge the ends of the earth  and he shall give strength unto his king  and exalt the horn of his anointed   
    and elkanah went to ramah to his house  and the child did minister unto the lord before eli the priest   
   now the sons of eli  were  sons of belial  they knew not the lord   
   and the priests  custom with the people  was  that   when any man offered sacrifice  the priest s servant came  while the flesh was in seething  with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand   
   and he struck  it  into the pan  or kettle  or caldron  or pot  all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself  so they did in shiloh unto all the israelites that came thither   
   also before they burnt the fat  the priest s servant came  and said to the man that sacrificed  give flesh to roast for the priest  for he will not have sodden flesh of thee  but raw   
   and  if  any man said unto him  let them not fail to burn the fat presently  and  then  take  as much  as thy soul desireth  then he would answer him   nay   but thou shalt give  it me  now  and if not  i will take  it  by force   
   wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the lord  for men abhorred the offering of the lord   
   but samuel ministered before the lord   being  a child  girded with a linen ephod   
   moreover his mother made him a little coat  and brought  it  to him from year to year  when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice   
   and eli blessed elkanah and his wife  and said  the lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the lord  and they went unto their own home   
   and the lord visited hannah  so that she conceived  and bare three sons and two daughters  and the child samuel grew before the lord   
   now eli was very old  and heard all that his sons did unto all israel  and how they lay with the women that assembled  at  the door of the tabernacle of the congregation   
   and he said unto them  why do ye such things  for i hear of your evil dealings by all this people   
   nay  my sons  for  it is  no good report that i hear  ye make the lord s people to transgress   
   if one man sin against another  the judge shall judge him  but if a man sin against the lord  who shall intreat for him  notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father  because the lord would slay them   
   and the child samuel grew on  and was in favour both with the lord  and also with men   
    and there came a man of god unto eli  and said unto him  thus saith the lord  did i plainly appear unto the house of thy father  when they were in egypt in pharaoh s house   
   and did i choose him out of all the tribes of israel  to be  my priest  to offer upon mine altar  to burn incense  to wear an ephod before me  and did i give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of israel   
   wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering  which i have commanded  in my  habitation  and honourest thy sons above me  to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of israel my people   
   wherefore the lord god of israel saith  i said indeed  that  thy house  and the house of thy father  should walk before me for ever  but now the lord saith  be it far from me  for them that honour me i will honour  and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed   
   behold  the days come  that i will cut off thine arm  and the arm of thy father s house  that there shall not be an old man in thine house   
   and thou shalt see an enemy  in my  habitation  in all  the wealth  which  god  shall give israel  and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever   
   and the man of thine   whom  i shall not cut off from mine altar   shall be  to consume thine eyes  and to grieve thine heart  and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age   
   and this  shall be  a sign unto thee  that shall come upon thy two sons  on hophni and phinehas  in one day they shall die both of them   
   and i will raise me up a faithful priest   that  shall do according to  that  which  is  in mine heart and in my mind  and i will build him a sure house  and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever   
   and it shall come to pass   that  every one that is left in thine house shall come  and  crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread  and shall say  put me  i pray thee  into one of the priests  offices  that i may eat a piece of bread   
  samuel   
   and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli  and the word of the lord was precious in those days   there was  no open vision   
  and it came to pass at that time  when eli  was  laid down in his place  and his eyes began to wax dim   that  he could not see   
  and ere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord  where the ark of god  was   and samuel was laid down  to sleep    
  that the lord called samuel  and he answered  here  am  i   
  and he ran unto eli  and said  here  am  i  for thou calledst me  and he said  i called not  lie down again  and he went and lay down   
  and the lord called yet again  samuel  and samuel arose and went to eli  and said  here  am  i  for thou didst call me  and he answered  i called not  my son  lie down again   
  now samuel did not yet know the lord  neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him   
  and the lord called samuel again the third time  and he arose and went to eli  and said  here  am  i  for thou didst call me  and eli perceived that the lord had called the child   
  therefore eli said unto samuel  go  lie down  and it shall be  if he call thee  that thou shalt say  speak  lord  for thy servant heareth  so samuel went and lay down in his place   
   and the lord came  and stood  and called as at other times  samuel  samuel  then samuel answered  speak  for thy servant heareth   
    and the lord said to samuel  behold  i will do a thing in israel  at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle   
   in that day i will perform against eli all  things  which i have spoken concerning his house  when i begin  i will also make an end   
   for i have told him that i will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth  because his sons made themselves vile  and he restrained them not   
   and therefore i have sworn unto the house of eli  that the iniquity of eli s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever   
   and samuel lay until the morning  and opened the doors of the house of the lord  and samuel feared to shew eli the vision   
   then eli called samuel  and said  samuel  my son  and he answered  here  am  i   
   and he said  what  is  the thing that  the lord  hath said unto thee  i pray thee hide  it  not from me  god do so to thee  and more also  if thou hide  any  thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee   
   and samuel told him every whit  and hid nothing from him  and he said  it  is  the lord  let him do what seemeth him good   
    and samuel grew  and the lord was with him  and did let none of his words fall to the ground   
   and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel  was  established  to be  a prophet of the lord   
   and the lord appeared again in shiloh  for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord   
  samuel   
   and the word of samuel came to all israel  now israel went out against the philistines to battle  and pitched beside ebenezer  and the philistines pitched in aphek   
  and the philistines put themselves in array against israel  and when they joined battle  israel was smitten before the philistines  and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men   
  and when the people were come into the camp  the elders of israel said  wherefore hath the lord smitten us to day before the philistines  let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of shiloh unto us  that  when it cometh among us  it may save us out of the hand of our enemies   
  so the people sent to shiloh  that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts  which dwelleth  between  the cherubims  and the two sons of eli  hophni and phinehas   were  there with the ark of the covenant of god   
  and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the camp  all israel shouted with a great shout  so that the earth rang again   
  and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout  they said  what  meaneth  the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews  and they understood that the ark of the lord was come into the camp   
  and the philistines were afraid  for they said  god is come into the camp  and they said  woe unto us  for there hath not been such a thing heretofore   
  woe unto us  who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods  these  are  the gods that smote the egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness   
  be strong  and quit yourselves like men  o ye philistines  that ye be not servants unto the hebrews  as they have been to you  quit yourselves like men  and fight   
    and the philistines fought  and israel was smitten  and they fled every man into his tent  and there was a very great slaughter  for there fell of israel thirty thousand footmen   
   and the ark of god was taken  and the two sons of eli  hophni and phinehas  were slain   
    and there ran a man of benjamin out of the army  and came to shiloh the same day with his clothes rent  and with earth upon his head   
   and when he came  lo  eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching  for his heart trembled for the ark of god  and when the man came into the city  and told  it   all the city cried out   
   and when eli heard the noise of the crying  he said  what  meaneth  the noise of this tumult  and the man came in hastily  and told eli   
   now eli was ninety and eight years old  and his eyes were dim  that he could not see   
   and the man said unto eli  i  am  he that came out of the army  and i fled to day out of the army  and he said  what is there done  my son   
   and the messenger answered and said  israel is fled before the philistines  and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people  and thy two sons also  hophni and phinehas  are dead  and the ark of god is taken   
   and it came to pass  when he made mention of the ark of god  that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate  and his neck brake  and he died  for he was an old man  and heavy  and he had judged israel forty years   
    and his daughter in law  phinehas  wife  was with child   near  to be delivered  and when she heard the tidings that the ark of god was taken  and that her father in law and her husband were dead  she bowed herself and travailed  for her pains came upon her   
   and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her  fear not  for thou hast born a son  but she answered not  neither did she regard  it    
   and she named the child ichabod  saying  the glory is departed from israel  because the ark of god was taken  and because of her father in law and her husband   
   and she said  the glory is departed from israel  for the ark of god is taken   
  samuel   
   and the philistines took the ark of god  and brought it from ebenezer unto ashdod   
  when the philistines took the ark of god  they brought it into the house of dagon  and set it by dagon   
  and when they of ashdod arose early on the morrow  behold  dagon  was  fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the lord  and they took dagon  and set him in his place again   
  and when they arose early on the morrow morning  behold  dagon  was  fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord  and the head of dagon and both the palms of his hands  were  cut off upon the threshold  only  the stump of  dagon was left to him   
  therefore neither the priests of dagon  nor any that come into dagon s house  tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this day   
   but the hand of the lord was heavy upon them of ashdod  and he destroyed them  and smote them with emerods   even  ashdod and the coasts thereof   
  and when the men of ashdod saw that  it was  so  they said  the ark of the god of israel shall not abide with us  for his hand is sore upon us  and upon dagon our god   
  they sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the philistines unto them  and said  what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel  and they answered  let the ark of the god of israel be carried about unto gath  and they carried the ark of the god of israel about  thither    
  and it was  so   that  after they had carried it about  the hand of the lord was against the city with a very great destruction  and he smote the men of the city  both small and great  and they had emerods in their secret parts   
   therefore they sent the ark of god to ekron  and it came to pass  as the ark of god came to ekron  that the ekronites cried out  saying  they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us  to slay us and our people   
   so they sent and gathered together all the lords of the philistines  and said  send away the ark of the god of israel  and let it go again to his own place  that it slay us not  and our people  for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city  the hand of god was very heavy there   
   and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods  and the cry of the city went up to heaven   
  samuel   
   and the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines seven months   
  and the philistines called for the priests and the diviners  saying  what shall we do to the ark of the lord  tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place   
  and they said  if ye send away the ark of the god of israel  send it not empty  but in any wise return him a trespass offering  then ye shall be healed  and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you   
  then said they  what  shall be  the trespass offering which we shall return to him  they answered  five golden emerods  and five golden mice   according to  the number of the lords of the philistines  for one plague  was  on you all  and on your lords   
  wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods  and images of your mice that mar the land  and ye shall give glory unto the god of israel  peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you  and from off your gods  and from off your land   
  wherefore then do ye harden your hearts  as the egyptians and pharaoh hardened their hearts  when he had wrought wonderfully among them  did they not let the people go  and they departed   
  now therefore make a new cart  and take two milch kine  on which there hath come no yoke  and tie the kine to the cart  and bring their calves home from them   
  and take the ark of the lord  and lay it upon the cart  and put the jewels of gold  which ye return him  for  a trespass offering  in a coffer by the side thereof  and send it away  that it may go   
  and see  if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to bethshemesh   then  he hath done us this great evil  but if not  then we shall know that  it is  not his hand  that  smote us  it  was  a chance  that  happened to us   
    and the men did so  and took two milch kine  and tied them to the cart  and shut up their calves at home   
   and they laid the ark of the lord upon the cart  and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods   
   and the kine took the straight way to the way of bethshemesh   and  went along the highway  lowing as they went  and turned not aside  to  the right hand or  to  the left  and the lords of the philistines went after them unto the border of bethshemesh   
   and  they of  bethshemesh  were  reaping their wheat harvest in the valley  and they lifted up their eyes  and saw the ark  and rejoiced to see  it    
   and the cart came into the field of joshua  a bethshemite  and stood there  where  there was  a great stone  and they clave the wood of the cart  and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the lord   
   and the levites took down the ark of the lord  and the coffer that  was  with it  wherein the jewels of gold  were   and put  them  on the great stone  and the men of bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the lord   
   and when the five lords of the philistines had seen  it   they returned to ekron the same day   
   and these  are  the golden emerods which the philistines returned  for  a trespass offering unto the lord  for ashdod one  for gaza one  for askelon one  for gath one  for ekron one   
   and the golden mice   according to  the number of all the cities of the philistines  belonging  to the five lords   both  of fenced cities  and of country villages  even unto the great  stone of  abel  whereon they set down the ark of the lord   which stone remaineth  unto this day in the field of joshua  the bethshemite   
    and he smote the men of bethshemesh  because they had looked into the ark of the lord  even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men  and the people lamented  because the lord had smitten  many  of the people with a great slaughter   
   and the men of bethshemesh said  who is able to stand before this holy lord god  and to whom shall he go up from us   
   and they sent messengers to the inhabitants of kirjathjearim  saying  the philistines have brought again the ark of the lord  come ye down   and  fetch it up to you   
  samuel   
   and the men of kirjathjearim came  and fetched up the ark of the lord  and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill  and sanctified eleazar his son to keep the ark of the lord   
  and it came to pass  while the ark abode in kirjathjearim  that the time was long  for it was twenty years  and all the house of israel lamented after the lord   
   and samuel spake unto all the house of israel  saying  if ye do return unto the lord with all your hearts   then  put away the strange gods and ashtaroth from among you  and prepare your hearts unto the lord  and serve him only  and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines   
  then the children of israel did put away baalim and ashtaroth  and served the lord only   
  and samuel said  gather all israel to mizpeh  and i will pray for you unto the lord   
  and they gathered together to mizpeh  and drew water  and poured  it  out before the lord  and fasted on that day  and said there  we have sinned against the lord  and samuel judged the children of israel in mizpeh   
   and when the philistines heard that the children of israel were gathered together to mizpeh  the lords of the philistines went up against israel  and when the children of israel heard  it   they were afraid of the philistines   
  and the children of israel said to samuel  cease not to cry unto the lord our god for us  that he will save us out of the hand of the philistines   
  and samuel took a sucking lamb  and offered  it for  a burnt offering wholly unto the lord  and samuel cried unto the lord for israel  and the lord heard him   
   and as samuel was offering up the burnt offering  the philistines drew near to battle against israel  but the lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the philistines  and discomfited them  and they were smitten before israel   
   and the men of israel went out of mizpeh  and pursued the philistines  and smote them  until  they came  under bethcar   
   then samuel took a stone  and set  it  between mizpeh and shen  and called the name of it ebenezer  saying  hitherto hath the lord helped us   
    so the philistines were subdued  and they came no more into the coast of israel  and the hand of the lord was against the philistines all the days of samuel   
   and the cities which the philistines had taken from israel were restored to israel  from ekron even unto gath  and the coasts thereof did israel deliver out of the hands of the philistines  and there was peace between israel and the amorites   
   and samuel judged israel all the days of his life   
   and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel  and gilgal  and mizpeh  and judged israel in all those places   
   and his return  was  to ramah  for there  was  his house  and there he judged israel  and there he built an altar unto the lord   
  samuel   
   and it came to pass  when samuel was old  that he made his sons judges over israel   
  now the name of his firstborn was joel  and the name of his second  abiah   they were  judges in beersheba   
  and his sons walked not in his ways  but turned aside after lucre  and took bribes  and perverted judgment   
   then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together  and came to samuel unto ramah   
  and said unto him  behold  thou art old  and thy sons walk not in thy ways  now make us a king to judge us like all the nations   
  but the thing displeased samuel  when they said  give us a king to judge us  and samuel prayed unto the lord   
  and the lord said unto samuel  hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee  for they have not rejected thee  but they have rejected me  that i should not reign over them   
  according to all the works which they have done since the day that i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day  wherewith they have forsaken me  and served other gods  so do they also unto thee   
  now therefore hearken unto their voice  howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them  and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them   
   and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked of him a king   
   and he said  this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you  he will take your sons  and appoint  them  for himself  for his chariots  and  to be  his horsemen  and  some  shall run before his chariots   
   and he will appoint him captains over thousands  and captains over fifties  and  will set them  to ear his ground  and to reap his harvest  and to make his instruments of war  and instruments of his chariots   
   and he will take your daughters  to be  confectionaries  and  to be  cooks  and  to be  bakers   
   and he will take your fields  and your vineyards  and your oliveyards   even  the best  of them   and give  them  to his servants   
   and he will take the tenth of your seed  and of your vineyards  and give to his officers  and to his servants   
   and he will take your menservants  and your maidservants  and your goodliest young men  and your asses  and put  them  to his work   
   he will take the tenth of your sheep  and ye shall be his servants   
   and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you  and the lord will not hear you in that day   
   nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel  and they said  nay  but we will have a king over us   
   that we also may be like all the nations  and that our king may judge us  and go out before us  and fight our battles   
   and samuel heard all the words of the people  and he rehearsed them in the ears of the lord   
   and the lord said to samuel  hearken unto their voice  and make them a king  and samuel said unto the men of israel  go ye every man unto his city   
  samuel   
   now there was a man of benjamin  whose name  was  kish  the son of abiel  the son of zeror  the son of bechorath  the son of aphiah  a benjamite  a mighty man of power   
  and he had a son  whose name  was  saul  a choice young man  and a goodly  and  there was  not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he  from his shoulders and upward  he was  higher than any of the people   
   and the asses of kish saul s father were lost  and kish said to saul his son  take now one of the servants with thee  and arise  go seek the asses   
  and he passed through mount ephraim  and passed through the land of shalisha  but they found  them  not  then they passed through the land of shalim  and  there they were  not  and he passed through the land of the benjamites  but they found  them  not   
   and  when they were come to the land of zuph  saul said to his servant that  was  with him  come  and let us return  lest my father leave  caring  for the asses  and take thought for us   
  and he said unto him  behold now   there is  in this city a man of god  and  he is  an honourable man  all that he saith cometh surely to pass  now let us go thither  peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go   
  then said saul to his servant  but  behold   if  we go  what shall we bring the man  for the bread is spent in our vessels  and  there is  not a present to bring to the man of god  what have we   
  and the servant answered saul again  and said  behold  i have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver   that  will i give to the man of god  to tell us our way   
   beforetime in israel  when a man went to enquire of god  thus he spake  come  and let us go to the seer  for  he that is  now  called  a prophet was beforetime called a seer    
   then said saul to his servant  well said  come  let us go  so they went unto the city where the man of god  was    
     and  as they went up the hill to the city  they found young maidens going out to draw water  and said unto them  is the seer here   
   and they answered them  and said  he is  behold   he is  before you  make haste now  for he came to day to the city  for  there is  a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place   
   as soon as ye be come into the city  ye shall straightway find him  before he go up to the high place to eat  for the people will not eat until he come  because he doth bless the sacrifice   and  afterwards they eat that be bidden  now therefore get you up  for about this time ye shall find him   
   and they went up into the city   and  when they were come into the city  behold  samuel came out against them  for to go up to the high place   
   now the lord had told samuel in his ear a day before saul came  saying   
   to morrow about this time i will send thee a man out of the land of benjamin  and thou shalt anoint him  to be  captain over my people israel  that he may save my people out of the hand of the philistines  for i have looked upon my people  because their cry is come unto me   
   and when samuel saw saul  the lord said unto him  behold the man whom i spake to thee of  this same shall reign over my people   
    then saul drew near to samuel in the gate  and said  tell me  i pray thee  where the seer s house  is    
   and samuel answered saul  and said  i  am  the seer  go up before me unto the high place  for ye shall eat with me to day  and to morrow i will let thee go  and will tell thee all that  is  in thine heart   
   and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago  set not thy mind on them  for they are found  and on whom  is  all the desire of israel   is it  not on thee  and on all thy father s house   
   and saul answered and said   am  not i a benjamite  of the smallest of the tribes of israel  and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of benjamin  wherefore then speakest thou so to me   
   and samuel took saul and his servant  and brought them into the parlour  and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden  which  were  about thirty persons   
   and samuel said unto the cook  bring the portion which i gave thee  of which i said unto thee  set it by thee   
   and the cook took up the shoulder  and  that  which  was  upon it  and set  it  before saul  and  samuel  said  behold that which is left  set  it  before thee   and  eat  for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since i said  i have invited the people  so saul did eat with samuel that day   
   and when they were come down from the high place into the city   samuel  communed with saul upon the top of the house   
   and they arose early  and it came to pass about the spring of the day  that samuel called saul to the top of the house  saying  up  that i may send thee away  and saul arose  and they went out both of them  he and samuel  abroad   
    and  as they were going down to the end of the city  samuel said to saul  bid the servant pass on before us   and he passed on   but stand thou still a while  that i may shew thee the word of god   
  samuel    
   then samuel took a vial of oil  and poured  it  upon his head  and kissed him  and said   is it  not because the lord hath anointed thee  to be  captain over his inheritance   
  when thou art departed from me to day  then thou shalt find two men by rachel s sepulchre in the border of benjamin at zelzah  and they will say unto thee  the asses which thou wentest to seek are found  and  lo  thy father hath left the care of the asses  and sorroweth for you  saying  what shall i do for my son   
  then shalt thou go on forward from thence  and thou shalt come to the plain of tabor  and there shall meet thee three men going up to god to bethel  one carrying three kids  and another carrying three loaves of bread  and another carrying a bottle of wine   
  and they will salute thee  and give thee two  loaves  of bread  which thou shalt receive of their hands   
  after that thou shalt come to the hill of god  where  is  the garrison of the philistines  and it shall come to pass  when thou art come thither to the city  that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery  and a tabret  and a pipe  and a harp  before them  and they shall prophesy   
  and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee  and thou shalt prophesy with them  and shalt be turned into another man   
  and let it be  when these signs are come unto thee   that  thou do as occasion serve thee  for god  is  with thee   
  and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal  and  behold  i will come down unto thee  to offer burnt offerings   and  to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings  seven days shalt thou tarry  till i come to thee  and shew thee what thou shalt do   
   and it was  so   that when he had turned his back to go from samuel  god gave him another heart  and all those signs came to pass that day   
   and when they came thither to the hill  behold  a company of prophets met him  and the spirit of god came upon him  and he prophesied among them   
   and it came to pass  when all that knew him beforetime saw that  behold  he prophesied among the prophets  then the people said one to another  what  is  this  that  is come unto the son of kish   is  saul also among the prophets   
   and one of the same place answered and said  but who  is  their father  therefore it became a proverb   is  saul also among the prophets   
   and when he had made an end of prophesying  he came to the high place   
   and saul s uncle said unto him and to his servant  whither went ye  and he said  to seek the asses  and when we saw that  they were  no where  we came to samuel   
   and saul s uncle said  tell me  i pray thee  what samuel said unto you   
   and saul said unto his uncle  he told us plainly that the asses were found  but of the matter of the kingdom  whereof samuel spake  he told him not   
    and samuel called the people together unto the lord to mizpeh   
   and said unto the children of israel  thus saith the lord god of israel  i brought up israel out of egypt  and delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians  and out of the hand of all kingdoms   and  of them that oppressed you   
   and ye have this day rejected your god  who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations  and ye have said unto him   nay   but set a king over us  now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes  and by your thousands   
   and when samuel had caused all the tribes of israel to come near  the tribe of benjamin was taken   
   when he had caused the tribe of benjamin to come near by their families  the family of matri was taken  and saul the son of kish was taken  and when they sought him  he could not be found   
   therefore they enquired of the lord further  if the man should yet come thither  and the lord answered  behold  he hath hid himself among the stuff   
   and they ran and fetched him thence  and when he stood among the people  he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward   
   and samuel said to all the people  see ye him whom the lord hath chosen  that  there is  none like him among all the people  and all the people shouted  and said  god save the king   
   then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom  and wrote  it  in a book  and laid  it  up before the lord  and samuel sent all the people away  every man to his house   
   and saul also went home to gibeah  and there went with him a band of men  whose hearts god had touched   
   but the children of belial said  how shall this man save us  and they despised him  and brought him no presents  but he held his peace   
  samuel    
   then nahash the ammonite came up  and encamped against jabeshgilead  and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash  make a covenant with us  and we will serve thee   
  and nahash the ammonite answered them  on this  condition  will i make  a covenant  with you  that i may thrust out all your right eyes  and lay it  for  a reproach upon all israel   
  and the elders of jabesh said unto him  give us seven days  respite  that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of israel  and then  if  there be  no man to save us  we will come out to thee   
  then came the messengers to gibeah of saul  and told the tidings in the ears of the people  and all the people lifted up their voices  and wept   
   and  behold  saul came after the herd out of the field  and saul said  what  aileth  the people that they weep  and they told him the tidings of the men of jabesh   
  and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings  and his anger was kindled greatly   
  and he took a yoke of oxen  and hewed them in pieces  and sent  them  throughout all the coasts of israel by the hands of messengers  saying  whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel  so shall it be done unto his oxen  and the fear of the lord fell on the people  and they came out with one consent   
  and when he numbered them in bezek  the children of israel were three hundred thousand  and the men of judah thirty thousand   
  and they said unto the messengers that came  thus shall ye say unto the men of jabeshgilead  to morrow  by  that time  the sun be hot  ye shall have help  and the messengers came and shewed  it  to the men of jabesh  and they were glad   
   therefore the men of jabesh said  to morrow we will come out unto you  and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you   
   and it was  so  on the morrow  that saul put the people in three companies  and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch  and slew the ammonites until the heat of the day  and it came to pass  that they which remained were scattered  so that two of them were not left together   
    and the people said unto samuel  who  is  he that said  shall saul reign over us  bring the men  that we may put them to death   
   and saul said  there shall not a man be put to death this day  for to day the lord hath wrought salvation in israel   
   then said samuel to the people  come  and let us go to gilgal  and renew the kingdom there   
   and all the people went to gilgal  and there they made saul king before the lord in gilgal  and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the lord  and there saul and all the men of israel rejoiced greatly   
  samuel    
   and samuel said unto all israel  behold  i have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me  and have made a king over you   
  and now  behold  the king walketh before you  and i am old and grayheaded  and  behold  my sons  are  with you  and i have walked before you from my childhood unto this day   
  behold  here i  am   witness against me before the lord  and before his anointed  whose ox have i taken  or whose ass have i taken  or whom have i defrauded  whom have i oppressed  or of whose hand have i received  any  bribe to blind mine eyes therewith  and i will restore it you   
  and they said  thou hast not defrauded us  nor oppressed us  neither hast thou taken ought of any man s hand   
  and he said unto them  the lord  is  witness against you  and his anointed  is  witness this day  that ye have not found ought in my hand  and they answered   he is  witness   
   and samuel said unto the people   it is  the lord that advanced moses and aaron  and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt   
  now therefore stand still  that i may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous acts of the lord  which he did to you and to your fathers   
  when jacob was come into egypt  and your fathers cried unto the lord  then the lord sent moses and aaron  which brought forth your fathers out of egypt  and made them dwell in this place   
  and when they forgat the lord their god  he sold them into the hand of sisera  captain of the host of hazor  and into the hand of the philistines  and into the hand of the king of moab  and they fought against them   
   and they cried unto the lord  and said  we have sinned  because we have forsaken the lord  and have served baalim and ashtaroth  but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies  and we will serve thee   
   and the lord sent jerubbaal  and bedan  and jephthah  and samuel  and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side  and ye dwelled safe   
   and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon came against you  ye said unto me  nay  but a king shall reign over us  when the lord your god  was  your king   
   now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen   and  whom ye have desired  and  behold  the lord hath set a king over you   
   if ye will fear the lord  and serve him  and obey his voice  and not rebel against the commandment of the lord  then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the lord your god   
   but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord  but rebel against the commandment of the lord  then shall the hand of the lord be against you  as  it was  against your fathers   
    now therefore stand and see this great thing  which the lord will do before your eyes   
    is it  not wheat harvest to day  i will call unto the lord  and he shall send thunder and rain  that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness  is  great  which ye have done in the sight of the lord  in asking you a king   
   so samuel called unto the lord  and the lord sent thunder and rain that day  and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel   
   and all the people said unto samuel  pray for thy servants unto the lord thy god  that we die not  for we have added unto all our sins  this  evil  to ask us a king   
   and samuel said unto the people  fear not  ye have done all this wickedness  yet turn not aside from following the lord  but serve the lord with all your heart   
   and turn ye not aside  for  then should ye go  after vain  things   which cannot profit nor deliver  for they  are  vain   
   for the lord will not forsake his people for his great name s sake  because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people   
   moreover as for me  god forbid that i should sin against the lord in ceasing to pray for you  but i will teach you the good and the right way   
   only fear the lord  and serve him in truth with all your heart  for consider how great  things  he hath done for you   
   but if ye shall still do wickedly  ye shall be consumed  both ye and your king   
  samuel    
   saul reigned one year  and when he had reigned two years over israel   
  saul chose him three thousand  men  of israel   whereof  two thousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel  and a thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin  and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent   
  and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that  was  in geba  and the philistines heard  of it   and saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land  saying  let the hebrews hear   
  and all israel heard say  that  saul had smitten a garrison of the philistines  and  that  israel also was had in abomination with the philistines  and the people were called together after saul to gilgal   
  and the philistines gathered themselves together to fight with israel  thirty thousand chariots  and six thousand horsemen  and people as the sand which  is  on the sea shore in multitude  and they came up  and pitched in michmash  eastward from bethaven   
  when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait   for the people were distressed   then the people did hide themselves in caves  and in thickets  and in rocks  and in high places  and in pits   
  and  some of  the hebrews went over jordan to the land of gad and gilead  as for saul  he  was  yet in gilgal  and all the people followed him trembling   
   and he tarried seven days  according to the set time that samuel  had appointed   but samuel came not to gilgal  and the people were scattered from him   
  and saul said  bring hither a burnt offering to me  and peace offerings  and he offered the burnt offering   
   and it came to pass  that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering  behold  samuel came  and saul went out to meet him  that he might salute him   
   and samuel said  what hast thou done  and saul said  because i saw that the people were scattered from me  and  that  thou camest not within the days appointed  and  that  the philistines gathered themselves together at michmash   
   therefore said i  the philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal  and i have not made supplication unto the lord  i forced myself therefore  and offered a burnt offering   
   and samuel said to saul  thou hast done foolishly  thou hast not kept the commandment of the lord thy god  which he commanded thee  for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel for ever   
   but now thy kingdom shall not continue  the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart  and the lord hath commanded him  to be  captain over his people  because thou hast not kept  that  which the lord commanded thee   
    and samuel arose  and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of benjamin  and saul numbered the people  that were  present with him  about six hundred men   
   and saul  and jonathan his son  and the people  that were  present with them  abode in gibeah of benjamin  but the philistines encamped in michmash   
   and the spoilers came out of the camp of the philistines in three companies  one company turned unto the way  that leadeth to  ophrah  unto the land of shual   
   and another company turned the way  to  bethhoron  and another company turned  to  the way of the border that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness   
   now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel  for the philistines said  lest the hebrews make  them  swords or spears   
   but all the israelites went down to the philistines  to sharpen every man his share  and his coulter  and his axe  and his mattock   
   yet they had a file for the mattocks  and for the coulters  and for the forks  and for the axes  and to sharpen the goads   
   so it came to pass in the day of battle  that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that  were  with saul and jonathan  but with saul and with jonathan his son was there found   
   and the garrison of the philistines went out to the passage of michmash   
  samuel    
   now it came to pass upon a day  that jonathan the son of saul said unto the young man that bare his armour  come  and let us go over to the philistines  garrison  that  is  on the other side  but he told not his father   
  and saul tarried in the uttermost part of gibeah under a pomegranate tree which  is  in migron  and the people that  were  with him  were  about six hundred men   
  and ahiah  the son of ahitub  ichabod s brother  the son of phinehas  the son of eli  the lord s priest in shiloh  wearing an ephod  and the people knew not that jonathan was gone   
  and between the passages  by which jonathan sought to go over unto the philistines  garrison   there was  a sharp rock on the one side  and a sharp rock on the other side  and the name of the one  was  bozez  and the name of the other seneh   
  the forefront of the one  was  situate northward over against michmash  and the other southward over against gibeah   
  and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour  come  and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised  it may be that the lord will work for us  for  there is  no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few   
  and his armourbearer said unto him  do all that  is  in thine heart  turn thee  behold  i  am  with thee according to thy heart   
  then said jonathan  behold  we will pass over unto  these  men  and we will discover ourselves unto them   
  if they say thus unto us  tarry until we come to you  then we will stand still in our place  and will not go up unto them   
   but if they say thus  come up unto us  then we will go up  for the lord hath delivered them into our hand  and this  shall be  a sign unto us   
   and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the philistines  and the philistines said  behold  the hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves   
   and the men of the garrison answered jonathan and his armourbearer  and said  come up to us  and we will shew you a thing  and jonathan said unto his armourbearer  come up after me  for the lord hath delivered them into the hand of israel   
   and jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet  and his armourbearer after him  and they fell before jonathan  and his armourbearer slew after him   
   and that first slaughter  which jonathan and his armourbearer made  was about twenty men  within as it were an half acre of land   which  a yoke  of oxen might plow    
   and there was trembling in the host  in the field  and among all the people  the garrison  and the spoilers  they also trembled  and the earth quaked  so it was a very great trembling   
    and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin looked  and  behold  the multitude melted away  and they went on beating down  one another    
   then said saul unto the people that  were  with him  number now  and see who is gone from us  and when they had numbered  behold  jonathan and his armourbearer  were  not  there    
   and saul said unto ahiah  bring hither the ark of god  for the ark of god was at that time with the children of israel   
   and it came to pass  while saul talked unto the priest  that the noise that  was  in the host of the philistines went on and increased  and saul said unto the priest  withdraw thine hand   
   and saul and all the people that  were  with him assembled themselves  and they came to the battle  and  behold  every man s sword was against his fellow   and there was  a very great discomfiture   
   moreover the hebrews  that  were with the philistines before that time  which went up with them into the camp  from the country  round about  even they also  turned  to be with the israelites that  were  with saul and jonathan   
   likewise all the men of israel which had hid themselves in mount ephraim   when  they heard that the philistines fled  even they also followed hard after them in the battle   
   so the lord saved israel that day  and the battle passed over unto bethaven   
    and the men of israel were distressed that day  for saul had adjured the people  saying  cursed  be  the man that eateth  any  food until evening  that i may be avenged on mine enemies  so none of the people tasted  any  food   
   and all  they of  the land came to a wood  and there was honey upon the ground   
   and when the people were come into the wood  behold  the honey dropped  but no man put his hand to his mouth  for the people feared the oath   
   but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath  wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that  was  in his hand  and dipped it in an honeycomb  and put his hand to his mouth  and his eyes were enlightened   
   then answered one of the people  and said  thy father straitly charged the people with an oath  saying  cursed  be  the man that eateth  any  food this day  and the people were faint   
   then said jonathan  my father hath troubled the land  see  i pray you  how mine eyes have been enlightened  because i tasted a little of this honey   
   how much more  if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found  for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the philistines   
   and they smote the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon  and the people were very faint   
   and the people flew upon the spoil  and took sheep  and oxen  and calves  and slew  them  on the ground  and the people did eat  them  with the blood   
   then they told saul  saying  behold  the people sin against the lord  in that they eat with the blood  and he said  ye have transgressed  roll a great stone unto me this day   
   and saul said  disperse yourselves among the people  and say unto them  bring me hither every man his ox  and every man his sheep  and slay  them  here  and eat  and sin not against the lord in eating with the blood  and all the people brought every man his ox with him that night  and slew  them  there   
   and saul built an altar unto the lord  the same was the first altar that he built unto the lord   
    and saul said  let us go down after the philistines by night  and spoil them until the morning light  and let us not leave a man of them  and they said  do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee  then said the priest  let us draw near hither unto god   
   and saul asked counsel of god  shall i go down after the philistines  wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel  but he answered him not that day   
   and saul said  draw ye near hither  all the chief of the people  and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day   
   for   as  the lord liveth  which saveth israel  though it be in jonathan my son  he shall surely die  but  there was  not a man among all the people  that  answered him   
   then said he unto all israel  be ye on one side  and i and jonathan my son will be on the other side  and the people said unto saul  do what seemeth good unto thee   
   therefore saul said unto the lord god of israel  give a perfect  lot   and saul and jonathan were taken  but the people escaped   
   and saul said  cast  lots  between me and jonathan my son  and jonathan was taken   
   then saul said to jonathan  tell me what thou hast done  and jonathan told him  and said  i did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that  was  in mine hand   and   lo  i must die   
   and saul answered  god do so and more also  for thou shalt surely die  jonathan   
   and the people said unto saul  shall jonathan die  who hath wrought this great salvation in israel  god forbid   as  the lord liveth  there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground  for he hath wrought with god this day  so the people rescued jonathan  that he died not   
   then saul went up from following the philistines  and the philistines went to their own place   
    so saul took the kingdom over israel  and fought against all his enemies on every side  against moab  and against the children of ammon  and against edom  and against the kings of zobah  and against the philistines  and whithersoever he turned himself  he vexed  them    
   and he gathered an host  and smote the amalekites  and delivered israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them   
   now the sons of saul were jonathan  and ishui  and melchishua  and the names of his two daughters  were these   the name of the firstborn merab  and the name of the younger michal   
   and the name of saul s wife  was  ahinoam  the daughter of ahimaaz  and the name of the captain of his host  was  abner  the son of ner  saul s uncle   
   and kish  was  the father of saul  and ner the father of abner  was  the son of abiel   
   and there was sore war against the philistines all the days of saul  and when saul saw any strong man  or any valiant man  he took him unto him   
  samuel    
   samuel also said unto saul  the lord sent me to anoint thee  to be  king over his people  over israel  now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the lord   
  thus saith the lord of hosts  i remember  that  which amalek did to israel  how he laid  wait  for him in the way  when he came up from egypt   
  now go and smite amalek  and utterly destroy all that they have  and spare them not  but slay both man and woman  infant and suckling  ox and sheep  camel and ass   
  and saul gathered the people together  and numbered them in telaim  two hundred thousand footmen  and ten thousand men of judah   
  and saul came to a city of amalek  and laid wait in the valley   
  and saul said unto the kenites  go  depart  get you down from among the amalekites  lest i destroy you with them  for ye shewed kindness to all the children of israel  when they came up out of egypt  so the kenites departed from among the amalekites   
  and saul smote the amalekites from havilah  until  thou comest to shur  that  is  over against egypt   
  and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive  and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword   
  but saul and the people spared agag  and the best of the sheep  and of the oxen  and of the fatlings  and the lambs  and all  that was  good  and would not utterly destroy them  but every thing  that was  vile and refuse  that they destroyed utterly   
    then came the word of the lord unto samuel  saying   
   it repenteth me that i have set up saul  to be  king  for he is turned back from following me  and hath not performed my commandments  and it grieved samuel  and he cried unto the lord all night   
   and when samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning  it was told samuel  saying  saul came to carmel  and  behold  he set him up a place  and is gone about  and passed on  and gone down to gilgal   
   and samuel came to saul  and saul said unto him  blessed  be  thou of the lord  i have performed the commandment of the lord   
   and samuel said  what  meaneth  then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears  and the lowing of the oxen which i hear   
   and saul said  they have brought them from the amalekites  for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen  to sacrifice unto the lord thy god  and the rest we have utterly destroyed   
   then samuel said unto saul  stay  and i will tell thee what the lord hath said to me this night  and he said unto him  say on   
   and samuel said  when thou  wast  little in thine own sight   wast  thou not  made  the head of the tribes of israel  and the lord anointed thee king over israel   
   and the lord sent thee on a journey  and said  go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites  and fight against them until they be consumed   
   wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the lord  but didst fly upon the spoil  and didst evil in the sight of the lord   
   and saul said unto samuel  yea  i have obeyed the voice of the lord  and have gone the way which the lord sent me  and have brought agag the king of amalek  and have utterly destroyed the amalekites   
   but the people took of the spoil  sheep and oxen  the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed  to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal   
   and samuel said  hath the lord  as great  delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices  as in obeying the voice of the lord  behold  to obey  is  better than sacrifice   and  to hearken than the fat of rams   
   for rebellion  is as  the sin of witchcraft  and stubbornness  is as  iniquity and idolatry  because thou hast rejected the word of the lord  he hath also rejected thee from  being  king   
    and saul said unto samuel  i have sinned  for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord  and thy words  because i feared the people  and obeyed their voice   
   now therefore  i pray thee  pardon my sin  and turn again with me  that i may worship the lord   
   and samuel said unto saul  i will not return with thee  for thou hast rejected the word of the lord  and the lord hath rejected thee from being king over israel   
   and as samuel turned about to go away  he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle  and it rent   
   and samuel said unto him  the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day  and hath given it to a neighbour of thine   that is  better than thou   
   and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent  for he  is  not a man  that he should repent   
   then he said  i have sinned   yet  honour me now  i pray thee  before the elders of my people  and before israel  and turn again with me  that i may worship the lord thy god   
   so samuel turned again after saul  and saul worshipped the lord   
    then said samuel  bring ye hither to me agag the king of the amalekites  and agag came unto him delicately  and agag said  surely the bitterness of death is past   
   and samuel said  as thy sword hath made women childless  so shall thy mother be childless among women  and samuel hewed agag in pieces before the lord in gilgal   
   then samuel went to ramah  and saul went up to his house to gibeah of saul   
   and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his death  nevertheless samuel mourned for saul  and the lord repented that he had made saul king over israel   
  samuel    
   and the lord said unto samuel  how long wilt thou mourn for saul  seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel  fill thine horn with oil  and go  i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite  for i have provided me a king among his sons   
  and samuel said  how can i go  if saul hear  it   he will kill me  and the lord said  take an heifer with thee  and say  i am come to sacrifice to the lord   
  and call jesse to the sacrifice  and i will shew thee what thou shalt do  and thou shalt anoint unto me  him  whom i name unto thee   
  and samuel did that which the lord spake  and came to bethlehem  and the elders of the town trembled at his coming  and said  comest thou peaceably   
  and he said  peaceably  i am come to sacrifice unto the lord  sanctify yourselves  and come with me to the sacrifice  and he sanctified jesse and his sons  and called them to the sacrifice   
   and it came to pass  when they were come  that he looked on eliab  and said  surely the lord s anointed  is  before him   
  but the lord said unto samuel  look not on his countenance  or on the height of his stature  because i have refused him  for  the lord seeth  not as man seeth  for man looketh on the outward appearance  but the lord looketh on the heart   
  then jesse called abinadab  and made him pass before samuel  and he said  neither hath the lord chosen this   
  then jesse made shammah to pass by  and he said  neither hath the lord chosen this   
   again  jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel  and samuel said unto jesse  the lord hath not chosen these   
   and samuel said unto jesse  are here all  thy  children  and he said  there remaineth yet the youngest  and  behold  he keepeth the sheep  and samuel said unto jesse  send and fetch him  for we will not sit down till he come hither   
   and he sent  and brought him in  now he  was  ruddy   and  withal of a beautiful countenance  and goodly to look to  and the lord said  arise  anoint him  for this  is  he   
   then samuel took the horn of oil  and anointed him in the midst of his brethren  and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward  so samuel rose up  and went to ramah   
    but the spirit of the lord departed from saul  and an evil spirit from the lord troubled him   
   and saul s servants said unto him  behold now  an evil spirit from god troubleth thee   
   let our lord now command thy servants   which are  before thee  to seek out a man   who is  a cunning player on an harp  and it shall come to pass  when the evil spirit from god is upon thee  that he shall play with his hand  and thou shalt be well   
   and saul said unto his servants  provide me now a man that can play well  and bring  him  to me   
   then answered one of the servants  and said  behold  i have seen a son of jesse the bethlehemite   that is  cunning in playing  and a mighty valiant man  and a man of war  and prudent in matters  and a comely person  and the lord  is  with him   
   wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse  and said  send me david thy son  which  is  with the sheep   
   and jesse took an ass  laden  with bread  and a bottle of wine  and a kid  and sent  them  by david his son unto saul   
   and david came to saul  and stood before him  and he loved him greatly  and he became his armourbearer   
   and saul sent to jesse  saying  let david  i pray thee  stand before me  for he hath found favour in my sight   
   and it came to pass  when the  evil  spirit from god was upon saul  that david took an harp  and played with his hand  so saul was refreshed  and was well  and the evil spirit departed from him   
  samuel    
   now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle  and were gathered together at shochoh  which  belongeth  to judah  and pitched between shochoh and azekah  in ephesdammim   
  and saul and the men of israel were gathered together  and pitched by the valley of elah  and set the battle in array against the philistines   
  and the philistines stood on a mountain on the one side  and israel stood on a mountain on the other side  and  there was  a valley between them   
  and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines  named goliath  of gath  whose height  was  six cubits and a span   
  and  he had  an helmet of brass upon his head  and he  was  armed with a coat of mail  and the weight of the coat  was  five thousand shekels of brass   
  and  he had  greaves of brass upon his legs  and a target of brass between his shoulders   
  and the staff of his spear  was  like a weaver s beam  and his spear s head  weighed  six hundred shekels of iron  and one bearing a shield went before him   
  and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel  and said unto them  why are ye come out to set  your  battle in array   am  not i a philistine  and ye servants to saul  choose you a man for you  and let him come down to me   
  if he be able to fight with me  and to kill me  then will we be your servants  but if i prevail against him  and kill him  then shall ye be our servants  and serve us   
   and the philistine said  i defy the armies of israel this day  give me a man  that we may fight together   
   when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine  they were dismayed  and greatly afraid   
    now david  was  the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudah  whose name  was  jesse  and he had eight sons  and the man went among men  for  an old man in the days of saul   
   and the three eldest sons of jesse went  and  followed saul to the battle  and the names of his three sons that went to the battle  were  eliab the firstborn  and next unto him abinadab  and the third shammah   
   and david  was  the youngest  and the three eldest followed saul   
   but david went and returned from saul to feed his father s sheep at bethlehem   
   and the philistine drew near morning and evening  and presented himself forty days   
   and jesse said unto david his son  take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched  corn   and these ten loaves  and run to the camp to thy brethren   
   and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of  their  thousand  and look how thy brethren fare  and take their pledge   
   now saul  and they  and all the men of israel   were  in the valley of elah  fighting with the philistines   
   and david rose up early in the morning  and left the sheep with a keeper  and took  and went  as jesse had commanded him  and he came to the trench  as the host was going forth to the fight  and shouted for the battle   
   for israel and the philistines had put the battle in array  army against army   
   and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage  and ran into the army  and came and saluted his brethren   
   and as he talked with them  behold  there came up the champion  the philistine of gath  goliath by name  out of the armies of the philistines  and spake according to the same words  and david heard  them    
   and all the men of israel  when they saw the man  fled from him  and were sore afraid   
   and the men of israel said  have ye seen this man that is come up  surely to defy israel is he come up  and it shall be   that  the man who killeth him  the king will enrich him with great riches  and will give him his daughter  and make his father s house free in israel   
   and david spake to the men that stood by him  saying  what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine  and taketh away the reproach from israel  for who  is  this uncircumcised philistine  that he should defy the armies of the living god   
   and the people answered him after this manner  saying  so shall it be done to the man that killeth him   
   and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men  and eliab s anger was kindled against david  and he said  why camest thou down hither  and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness  i know thy pride  and the naughtiness of thine heart  for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle   
   and david said  what have i now done   is there  not a cause   
   and he turned from him toward another  and spake after the same manner  and the people answered him again after the former manner   
    and when the words were heard which david spake  they rehearsed  them  before saul  and he sent for him   
   and david said to saul  let no man s heart fail because of him  thy servant will go and fight with this philistine   
   and saul said to david  thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him  for thou  art but  a youth  and he a man of war from his youth   
   and david said unto saul  thy servant kept his father s sheep  and there came a lion  and a bear  and took a lamb out of the flock   
   and i went out after him  and smote him  and delivered  it  out of his mouth  and when he arose against me  i caught  him  by his beard  and smote him  and slew him   
   thy servant slew both the lion and the bear  and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them  seeing he hath defied the armies of the living god   
   david said moreover  the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion  and out of the paw of the bear  he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine  and saul said unto david  go  and the lord be with thee   
   and saul armed david with his armour  and he put an helmet of brass upon his head  also he armed him with a coat of mail   
   and david girded his sword upon his armour  and he assayed to go  for he had not proved  it   and david said unto saul  i cannot go with these  for i have not proved  them   and david put them off him   
    and he took his staff in his hand  and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook  and put them in a shepherd s bag which he had  even in a scrip  and his sling  was  in his hand  and he drew near to the philistine   
   and the philistine came on and drew near unto david  and the man that bare the shield  went  before him   
   and when the philistine looked about  and saw david  he disdained him  for he was  but  a youth  and ruddy  and of a fair countenance   
   and the philistine said unto david   am  i a dog  that thou comest to me with staves  and the philistine cursed david by his gods   
   and the philistine said to david  come to me  and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air  and to the beasts of the field   
   then said david to the philistine  thou comest to me with a sword  and with a spear  and with a shield  but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts  the god of the armies of israel  whom thou hast defied   
   this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand  and i will smite thee  and take thine head from thee  and i will give the carcases of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the air  and to the wild beasts of the earth  that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel   
   and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear  for the battle  is  the lord s  and he will give you into our hands   
    and it came to pass  when the philistine arose  and came and drew nigh to meet david  that david hasted  and ran toward the army to meet the philistine   
   and david put his hand in his bag  and took thence a stone  and slang  it   and smote the philistine in his forehead  that the stone sunk into his forehead  and he fell upon his face to the earth   
   so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a stone  and smote the philistine  and slew him  but  there was  no sword in the hand of david   
   therefore david ran  and stood upon the philistine  and took his sword  and drew it out of the sheath thereof  and slew him  and cut off his head therewith  and when the philistines saw their champion was dead  they fled   
   and the men of israel and of judah arose  and shouted  and pursued the philistines  until thou come to the valley  and to the gates of ekron  and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraim  even unto gath  and unto ekron   
   and the children of israel returned from chasing after the philistines  and they spoiled their tents   
   and david took the head of the philistine  and brought it to jerusalem  but he put his armour in his tent   
   and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine  he said unto abner  the captain of the host  abner  whose son  is  this youth  and abner said   as  thy soul liveth  o king  i cannot tell   
   and the king said  enquire thou whose son the stripling  is    
   and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine  abner took him  and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand   
   and saul said to him  whose son  art  thou   thou  young man  and david answered  i  am  the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite   
  samuel    
   and it came to pass  when he had made an end of speaking unto saul  that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david  and jonathan loved him as his own soul   
  and saul took him that day  and would let him go no more home to his father s house   
  then jonathan and david made a covenant  because he loved him as his own soul   
  and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that  was  upon him  and gave it to david  and his garments  even to his sword  and to his bow  and to his girdle   
  and david went out whithersoever saul sent him   and  behaved himself wisely  and saul set him over the men of war  and he was accepted in the sight of all the people  and also in the sight of saul s servants   
   and it came to pass as they came  when david was returned from the slaughter of the philistine  that the women came out of all cities of israel  singing and dancing  to meet king saul  with tabrets  with joy  and with instruments of musick   
  and the women answered  one another  as they played  and said  saul hath slain his thousands  and david his ten thousands   
  and saul was very wroth  and the saying displeased him  and he said  they have ascribed unto david ten thousands  and to me they have ascribed  but  thousands  and  what  can he have more but the kingdom   
  and saul eyed david from that day and forward   
   and it came to pass on the morrow  that the evil spirit from god came upon saul  and he prophesied in the midst of the house  and david played with his hand  as at other times  and  there was  a javelin in saul s hand   
   and saul cast the javelin  for he said  i will smite david even to the wall  with it   and david avoided out of his presence twice   
    and saul was afraid of david  because the lord was with him  and was departed from saul   
   therefore saul removed him from him  and made him his captain over a thousand  and he went out and came in before the people   
   and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways  and the lord  was  with him   
   wherefore when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely  he was afraid of him   
   but all israel and judah loved david  because he went out and came in before them   
   and saul said to david  behold my elder daughter merab  her will i give thee to wife  only be thou valiant for me  and fight the lord s battles  for saul said  let not mine hand be upon him  but let the hand of the philistines be upon him   
   and david said unto saul  who  am  i  and what  is  my life   or  my father s family in israel  that i should be son in law to the king   
   but it came to pass at the time when merab saul s daughter should have been given to david  that she was given unto adriel the meholathite to wife   
   and michal saul s daughter loved david  and they told saul  and the thing pleased him   
   and saul said  i will give him her  that she may be a snare to him  and that the hand of the philistines may be against him  wherefore saul said to david  thou shalt this day be my son in law in  the one of  the twain   
   and saul commanded his servants   saying   commune with david secretly  and say  behold  the king hath delight in thee  and all his servants love thee  now therefore be the king s son in law   
   and saul s servants spake those words in the ears of david  and david said  seemeth it to you  a  light  thing  to be a king s son in law  seeing that i  am  a poor man  and lightly esteemed   
   and the servants of saul told him  saying  on this manner spake david   
   and saul said  thus shall ye say to david  the king desireth not any dowry  but an hundred foreskins of the philistines  to be avenged of the king s enemies  but saul thought to make david fall by the hand of the philistines   
   and when his servants told david these words  it pleased david well to be the king s son in law  and the days were not expired   
   wherefore david arose and went  he and his men  and slew of the philistines two hundred men  and david brought their foreskins  and they gave them in full tale to the king  that he might be the king s son in law  and saul gave him michal his daughter to wife   
   and saul saw and knew that the lord  was  with david  and  that  michal saul s daughter loved him   
   and saul was yet the more afraid of david  and saul became david s enemy continually   
   then the princes of the philistines went forth  and it came to pass  after they went forth   that  david behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of saul  so that his name was much set by   
  samuel    
   and saul spake to jonathan his son  and to all his servants  that they should kill david   
  but jonathan saul s son delighted much in david  and jonathan told david  saying  saul my father seeketh to kill thee  now therefore  i pray thee  take heed to thyself until the morning  and abide in a secret  place   and hide thyself   
  and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou  art   and i will commune with my father of thee  and what i see  that i will tell thee   
  and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father  and said unto him  let not the king sin against his servant  against david  because he hath not sinned against thee  and because his works  have been  to thee ward very good   
  for he did put his life in his hand  and slew the philistine  and the lord wrought a great salvation for all israel  thou sawest  it   and didst rejoice  wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood  to slay david without a cause   
  and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan  and saul sware   as  the lord liveth  he shall not be slain   
  and jonathan called david  and jonathan shewed him all those things  and jonathan brought david to saul  and he was in his presence  as in times past   
   and there was war again  and david went out  and fought with the philistines  and slew them with a great slaughter  and they fled from him   
  and the evil spirit from the lord was upon saul  as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand  and david played with  his  hand   
   and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the javelin  but he slipped away out of saul s presence  and he smote the javelin into the wall  and david fled  and escaped that night   
    saul also sent messengers unto david s house  to watch him  and to slay him in the morning  and michal david s wife told him  saying  if thou save not thy life to night  to morrow thou shalt be slain   
   so michal let david down through a window  and he went  and fled  and escaped   
   and michal took an image  and laid  it  in the bed  and put a pillow of goats   hair  for his bolster  and covered  it  with a cloth   
   and when saul sent messengers to take david  she said  he  is  sick   
   and saul sent the messengers  again  to see david  saying  bring him up to me in the bed  that i may slay him   
   and when the messengers were come in  behold   there was  an image in the bed  with a pillow of goats   hair  for his bolster   
   and saul said unto michal  why hast thou deceived me so  and sent away mine enemy  that he is escaped  and michal answered saul  he said unto me  let me go  why should i kill thee   
    so david fled  and escaped  and came to samuel to ramah  and told him all that saul had done to him  and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth   
   and it was told saul  saying  behold  david  is  at naioth in ramah   
   and saul sent messengers to take david  and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying  and samuel standing  as  appointed over them  the spirit of god was upon the messengers of saul  and they also prophesied   
   and when it was told saul  he sent other messengers  and they prophesied likewise  and saul sent messengers again the third time  and they prophesied also   
   then went he also to ramah  and came to a great well that  is  in sechu  and he asked and said  where  are  samuel and david  and  one  said  behold   they be  at naioth in ramah   
   and he went thither to naioth in ramah  and the spirit of god was upon him also  and he went on  and prophesied  until he came to naioth in ramah   
   and he stripped off his clothes also  and prophesied before samuel in like manner  and lay down naked all that day and all that night  wherefore they say   is  saul also among the prophets   
  samuel    
   and david fled from naioth in ramah  and came and said before jonathan  what have i done  what  is  mine iniquity  and what  is  my sin before thy father  that he seeketh my life   
  and he said unto him  god forbid  thou shalt not die  behold  my father will do nothing either great or small  but that he will shew it me  and why should my father hide this thing from me  it  is  not  so    
  and david sware moreover  and said  thy father certainly knoweth that i have found grace in thine eyes  and he saith  let not jonathan know this  lest he be grieved  but truly  as  the lord liveth  and  as  thy soul liveth   there is  but a step between me and death   
  then said jonathan unto david  whatsoever thy soul desireth  i will even do  it  for thee   
  and david said unto jonathan  behold  to morrow  is  the new moon  and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat  but let me go  that i may hide myself in the field unto the third  day  at even   
  if thy father at all miss me  then say  david earnestly asked  leave  of me that he might run to bethlehem his city  for  there is  a yearly sacrifice there for all the family   
  if he say thus   it is  well  thy servant shall have peace  but if he be very wroth   then  be sure that evil is determined by him   
  therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant  for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee  notwithstanding  if there be in me iniquity  slay me thyself  for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father   
   and jonathan said  far be it from thee  for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee  then would not i tell it thee   
   then said david to jonathan  who shall tell me  or what  if  thy father answer thee roughly   
   and jonathan said unto david  come  and let us go out into the field  and they went out both of them into the field   
   and jonathan said unto david  o lord god of israel  when i have sounded my father about to morrow any time   or  the third  day   and  behold   if there be  good toward david  and i then send not unto thee  and shew it thee   
   the lord do so and much more to jonathan  but if it please my father  to do  thee evil  then i will shew it thee  and send thee away  that thou mayest go in peace  and the lord be with thee  as he hath been with my father   
   and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew me the kindness of the lord  that i die not   
   but  also  thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever  no  not when the lord hath cut off the enemies of david every one from the face of the earth   
   so jonathan made  a covenant  with the house of david   saying   let the lord even require  it  at the hand of david s enemies   
   and jonathan caused david to swear again  because he loved him  for he loved him as he loved his own soul   
   then jonathan said to david  to morrow  is  the new moon  and thou shalt be missed  because thy seat will be empty   
   and  when  thou hast stayed three days   then  thou shalt go down quickly  and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was  in hand   and shalt remain by the stone ezel   
   and i will shoot three arrows on the side  thereof   as though i shot at a mark   
   and  behold  i will send a lad   saying   go  find out the arrows  if i expressly say unto the lad  behold  the arrows  are  on this side of thee  take them  then come thou  for  there is  peace to thee  and no hurt   as  the lord liveth   
   but if i say thus unto the young man  behold  the arrows  are  beyond thee  go thy way  for the lord hath sent thee away   
   and  as touching  the matter which thou and i have spoken of  behold  the lord  be  between thee and me for ever   
    so david hid himself in the field  and when the new moon was come  the king sat him down to eat meat   
   and the king sat upon his seat  as at other times   even  upon a seat by the wall  and jonathan arose  and abner sat by saul s side  and david s place was empty   
   nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day  for he thought  something hath befallen him  he  is  not clean  surely he  is  not clean   
   and it came to pass on the morrow   which was  the second  day  of the month  that david s place was empty  and saul said unto jonathan his son  wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat  neither yesterday  nor to day   
   and jonathan answered saul  david earnestly asked  leave  of me  to go  to bethlehem   
   and he said  let me go  i pray thee  for our family hath a sacrifice in the city  and my brother  he hath commanded me  to be there   and now  if i have found favour in thine eyes  let me get away  i pray thee  and see my brethren  therefore he cometh not unto the king s table   
   then saul s anger was kindled against jonathan  and he said unto him  thou son of the perverse rebellious  woman   do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion  and unto the confusion of thy mother s nakedness   
   for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground  thou shalt not be established  nor thy kingdom  wherefore now send and fetch him unto me  for he shall surely die   
   and jonathan answered saul his father  and said unto him  wherefore shall he be slain  what hath he done   
   and saul cast a javelin at him to smite him  whereby jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay david   
   so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger  and did eat no meat the second day of the month  for he was grieved for david  because his father had done him shame   
    and it came to pass in the morning  that jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with david  and a little lad with him   
   and he said unto his lad  run  find out now the arrows which i shoot   and  as the lad ran  he shot an arrow beyond him   
   and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which jonathan had shot  jonathan cried after the lad  and said   is  not the arrow beyond thee   
   and jonathan cried after the lad  make speed  haste  stay not  and jonathan s lad gathered up the arrows  and came to his master   
   but the lad knew not any thing  only jonathan and david knew the matter   
   and jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad  and said unto him  go  carry  them  to the city   
    and  as soon as the lad was gone  david arose out of  a place  toward the south  and fell on his face to the ground  and bowed himself three times  and they kissed one another  and wept one with another  until david exceeded   
   and jonathan said to david  go in peace  forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord  saying  the lord be between me and thee  and between my seed and thy seed for ever  and he arose and departed  and jonathan went into the city   
  samuel    
   then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest  and ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of david  and said unto him  why  art  thou alone  and no man with thee   
  and david said unto ahimelech the priest  the king hath commanded me a business  and hath said unto me  let no man know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee  and what i have commanded thee  and i have appointed  my  servants to such and such a place   
  now therefore what is under thine hand  give  me  five  loaves of  bread in mine hand  or what there is present   
  and the priest answered david  and said   there is  no common bread under mine hand  but there is hallowed bread  if the young men have kept themselves at least from women   
  and david answered the priest  and said unto him  of a truth women  have been  kept from us about these three days  since i came out  and the vessels of the young men are holy  and  the bread is  in a manner common  yea  though it were sanctified this day in the vessel   
  so the priest gave him hallowed  bread   for there was no bread there but the shewbread  that was taken from before the lord  to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away   
  now a certain man of the servants of saul  was  there that day  detained before the lord  and his name  was  doeg  an edomite  the chiefest of the herdmen that  belonged  to saul   
  and david said unto ahimelech  and is there not here under thine hand spear or sword  for i have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me  because the king s business required haste   
  and the priest said  the sword of goliath the philistine  whom thou slewest in the valley of elah  behold  it  is here  wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod  if thou wilt take that  take  it   for  there is  no other save that here  and david said   there is  none like that  give it me   
    and david arose  and fled that day for fear of saul  and went to achish the king of gath   
   and the servants of achish said unto him   is  not this david the king of the land  did they not sing one to another of him in dances  saying  saul hath slain his thousands  and david his ten thousands   
   and david laid up these words in his heart  and was sore afraid of achish the king of gath   
   and he changed his behaviour before them  and feigned himself mad in their hands  and scrabbled on the doors of the gate  and let his spittle fall down upon his beard   
   then said achish unto his servants  lo  ye see the man is mad  wherefore  then  have ye brought him to me   
   have i need of mad men  that ye have brought this  fellow  to play the mad man in my presence  shall this  fellow  come into my house   
  samuel    
   david therefore departed thence  and escaped to the cave adullam  and when his brethren and all his father s house heard  it   they went down thither to him   
  and every one  that was  in distress  and every one that  was  in debt  and every one  that was  discontented  gathered themselves unto him  and he became a captain over them  and there were with him about four hundred men   
  and david went thence to mizpeh of moab  and he said unto the king of moab  let my father and my mother  i pray thee  come forth   and be  with you  till i know what god will do for me   
  and he brought them before the king of moab  and they dwelt with him all the while that david was in the hold   
  and the prophet gad said unto david  abide not in the hold  depart  and get thee into the land of judah  then david departed  and came into the forest of hareth   
   when saul heard that david was discovered  and the men that  were  with him   now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah  having his spear in his hand  and all his servants  were  standing about him    
  then saul said unto his servants that stood about him  hear now  ye benjamites  will the son of jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards   and  make you all captains of thousands  and captains of hundreds   
  that all of you have conspired against me  and  there is  none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of jesse  and  there is  none of you that is sorry for me  or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me  to lie in wait  as at this day   
  then answered doeg the edomite  which was set over the servants of saul  and said  i saw the son of jesse coming to nob  to ahimelech the son of ahitub   
   and he enquired of the lord for him  and gave him victuals  and gave him the sword of goliath the philistine   
   then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest  the son of ahitub  and all his father s house  the priests that  were  in nob  and they came all of them to the king   
   and saul said  hear now  thou son of ahitub  and he answered  here i  am   my lord   
   and saul said unto him  why have ye conspired against me  thou and the son of jesse  in that thou hast given him bread  and a sword  and hast enquired of god for him  that he should rise against me  to lie in wait  as at this day   
   then ahimelech answered the king  and said  and who  is so  faithful among all thy servants as david  which is the king s son in law  and goeth at thy bidding  and is honourable in thine house   
   did i then begin to enquire of god for him  be it far from me  let not the king impute  any  thing unto his servant   nor  to all the house of my father  for thy servant knew nothing of all this  less or more   
   and the king said  thou shalt surely die  ahimelech  thou  and all thy father s house   
   and the king said unto the footmen that stood about him  turn  and slay the priests of the lord  because their hand also  is  with david  and because they knew when he fled  and did not shew it to me  but the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the lord   
   and the king said to doeg  turn thou  and fall upon the priests  and doeg the edomite turned  and he fell upon the priests  and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod   
   and nob  the city of the priests  smote he with the edge of the sword  both men and women  children and sucklings  and oxen  and asses  and sheep  with the edge of the sword   
    and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub  named abiathar  escaped  and fled after david   
   and abiathar shewed david that saul had slain the lord s priests   
   and david said unto abiathar  i knew  it  that day  when doeg the edomite  was  there  that he would surely tell saul  i have occasioned  the death  of all the persons of thy father s house   
   abide thou with me  fear not  for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life  but with me thou  shalt be  in safeguard   
  samuel    
   then they told david  saying  behold  the philistines fight against keilah  and they rob the threshingfloors   
  therefore david enquired of the lord  saying  shall i go and smite these philistines  and the lord said unto david  go  and smite the philistines  and save keilah   
  and david s men said unto him  behold  we be afraid here in judah  how much more then if we come to keilah against the armies of the philistines   
  then david enquired of the lord yet again  and the lord answered him and said  arise  go down to keilah  for i will deliver the philistines into thine hand   
  so david and his men went to keilah  and fought with the philistines  and brought away their cattle  and smote them with a great slaughter  so david saved the inhabitants of keilah   
  and it came to pass  when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled to david to keilah   that  he came down  with  an ephod in his hand   
   and it was told saul that david was come to keilah  and saul said  god hath delivered him into mine hand  for he is shut in  by entering into a town that hath gates and bars   
  and saul called all the people together to war  to go down to keilah  to besiege david and his men   
  and david knew that saul secretly practised mischief against him  and he said to abiathar the priest  bring hither the ephod   
   then said david  o lord god of israel  thy servant hath certainly heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah  to destroy the city for my sake   
   will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand  will saul come down  as thy servant hath heard  o lord god of israel  i beseech thee  tell thy servant  and the lord said  he will come down   
   then said david  will the men of keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of saul  and the lord said  they will deliver  thee  up   
   then david and his men   which were  about six hundred  arose and departed out of keilah  and went whithersoever they could go  and it was told saul that david was escaped from keilah  and he forbare to go forth   
    and david abode in the wilderness in strong holds  and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of ziph  and saul sought him every day  but god delivered him not into his hand   
   and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life  and david  was  in the wilderness of ziph in a wood   
   and jonathan saul s son arose  and went to david into the wood  and strengthened his hand in god   
   and he said unto him  fear not  for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee  and thou shalt be king over israel  and i shall be next unto thee  and that also saul my father knoweth   
   and they two made a covenant before the lord  and david abode in the wood  and jonathan went to his house   
    then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah  saying  doth not david hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood  in the hill of hachilah  which  is  on the south of jeshimon   
   now therefore  o king  come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down  and our part  shall be  to deliver him into the king s hand   
   and saul said  blessed  be  ye of the lord  for ye have compassion on me   
   go  i pray you  prepare yet  and know and see his place where his haunt is   and  who hath seen him there  for it is told me  that  he dealeth very subtilly   
   see therefore  and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself  and come ye again to me with the certainty  and i will go with you  and it shall come to pass  if he be in the land  that i will search him out throughout all the thousands of judah   
   and they arose  and went to ziph before saul  but david and his men  were  in the wilderness of maon  in the plain on the south of jeshimon   
   saul also and his men went to seek  him   and they told david  wherefore he came down into a rock  and abode in the wilderness of maon  and when saul heard  that   he pursued after david in the wilderness of maon   
   and saul went on this side of the mountain  and david and his men on that side of the mountain  and david made haste to get away for fear of saul  for saul and his men compassed david and his men round about to take them   
   but there came a messenger unto saul  saying  haste thee  and come  for the philistines have invaded the land   
   wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david  and went against the philistines  therefore they called that place selahammahlekoth   
   and david went up from thence  and dwelt in strong holds at engedi   
  samuel    
   and it came to pass  when saul was returned from following the philistines  that it was told him  saying  behold  david  is  in the wilderness of engedi   
  then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel  and went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats   
  and he came to the sheepcotes by the way  where  was  a cave  and saul went in to cover his feet  and david and his men remained in the sides of the cave   
  and the men of david said unto him  behold the day of which the lord said unto thee  behold  i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand  that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee  then david arose  and cut off the skirt of saul s robe privily   
  and it came to pass afterward  that david s heart smote him  because he had cut off saul s skirt   
  and he said unto his men  the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master  the lord s anointed  to stretch forth mine hand against him  seeing he  is  the anointed of the lord   
  so david stayed his servants with these words  and suffered them not to rise against saul  but saul rose up out of the cave  and went on  his  way   
  david also arose afterward  and went out of the cave  and cried after saul  saying  my lord the king  and when saul looked behind him  david stooped with his face to the earth  and bowed himself   
   and david said to saul  wherefore hearest thou men s words  saying  behold  david seeketh thy hurt   
   behold  this day thine eyes have seen how that the lord had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave  and  some  bade  me  kill thee  but  mine eye  spared thee  and i said  i will not put forth mine hand against my lord  for he  is  the lord s anointed   
   moreover  my father  see  yea  see the skirt of thy robe in my hand  for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe  and killed thee not  know thou and see that  there is  neither evil nor transgression in mine hand  and i have not sinned against thee  yet thou huntest my soul to take it   
   the lord judge between me and thee  and the lord avenge me of thee  but mine hand shall not be upon thee   
   as saith the proverb of the ancients  wickedness proceedeth from the wicked  but mine hand shall not be upon thee   
   after whom is the king of israel come out  after whom dost thou pursue  after a dead dog  after a flea   
   the lord therefore be judge  and judge between me and thee  and see  and plead my cause  and deliver me out of thine hand   
    and it came to pass  when david had made an end of speaking these words unto saul  that saul said   is  this thy voice  my son david  and saul lifted up his voice  and wept   
   and he said to david  thou  art  more righteous than i  for thou hast rewarded me good  whereas i have rewarded thee evil   
   and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me  forasmuch as when the lord had delivered me into thine hand  thou killedst me not   
   for if a man find his enemy  will he let him go well away  wherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day   
   and now  behold  i know well that thou shalt surely be king  and that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thine hand   
   swear now therefore unto me by the lord  that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me  and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father s house   
   and david sware unto saul  and saul went home  but david and his men gat them up unto the hold   
  samuel    
   and samuel died  and all the israelites were gathered together  and lamented him  and buried him in his house at ramah  and david arose  and went down to the wilderness of paran   
   and  there was  a man in maon  whose possessions  were  in carmel  and the man  was  very great  and he had three thousand sheep  and a thousand goats  and he was shearing his sheep in carmel   
  now the name of the man  was  nabal  and the name of his wife abigail  and  she was  a woman of good understanding  and of a beautiful countenance  but the man  was  churlish and evil in his doings  and he  was  of the house of caleb   
  and david heard in the wilderness that nabal did shear his sheep   
  and david sent out ten young men  and david said unto the young men  get you up to carmel  and go to nabal  and greet him in my name   
  and thus shall ye say to him that liveth  in prosperity   peace  be  both to thee  and peace  be  to thine house  and peace  be  unto all that thou hast   
  and now i have heard that thou hast shearers  now thy shepherds which were with us  we hurt them not  neither was there ought missing unto them  all the while they were in carmel   
  ask thy young men  and they will shew thee  wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes  for we come in a good day  give  i pray thee  whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants  and to thy son david   
  and when david s young men came  they spake to nabal according to all those words in the name of david  and ceased   
   and nabal answered david s servants  and said  who  is  david  and who  is  the son of jesse  there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master   
   shall i then take my bread  and my water  and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers  and give  it  unto men  whom i know not whence they  be    
    so david s young men turned their way  and went again  and came and told him all those sayings   
   and david said unto his men  gird ye on every man his sword  and they girded on every man his sword  and david also girded on his sword  and there went up after david about four hundred men  and two hundred abode by the stuff   
   but one of the young men told abigail  nabal s wife  saying  behold  david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master  and he railed on them   
   but the men  were  very good unto us  and we were not hurt  neither missed we any thing  as long as we were conversant with them  when we were in the fields   
   they were a wall unto us both by night and day  all the while we were with them keeping the sheep   
   now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do  for evil is determined against our master  and against all his household  for he  is such  a son of belial  that  a man  cannot speak to him   
    then abigail made haste  and took two hundred loaves  and two bottles of wine  and five sheep ready dressed  and five measures of parched  corn   and an hundred clusters of raisins  and two hundred cakes of figs  and laid  them  on asses   
   and she said unto her servants  go on before me  behold  i come after you  but she told not her husband nabal   
   and it was  so  as  she rode on the ass  that she came down by the covert of the hill  and  behold  david and his men came down against her  and she met them   
   now david had said  surely in vain have i kept all that this  fellow  hath in the wilderness  so that nothing was missed of all that  pertained  unto him  and he hath requited me evil for good   
   so and more also do god unto the enemies of david  if i leave of all that  pertain  to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall   
   and when abigail saw david  she hasted  and lighted off the ass  and fell before david on her face  and bowed herself to the ground   
   and fell at his feet  and said  upon me  my lord   upon  me  let this  iniquity  be   and let thine handmaid  i pray thee  speak in thine audience  and hear the words of thine handmaid   
   let not my lord  i pray thee  regard this man of belial   even  nabal  for as his name  is   so  is  he  nabal  is  his name  and folly  is  with him  but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord  whom thou didst send   
   now therefore  my lord   as  the lord liveth  and  as  thy soul liveth  seeing the lord hath withholden thee from coming to  shed  blood  and from avenging thyself with thine own hand  now let thine enemies  and they that seek evil to my lord  be as nabal   
   and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord  let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord   
   i pray thee  forgive the trespass of thine handmaid  for the lord will certainly make my lord a sure house  because my lord fighteth the battles of the lord  and evil hath not been found in thee  all  thy days   
   yet a man is risen to pursue thee  and to seek thy soul  but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy god  and the souls of thine enemies  them shall he sling out   as out  of the middle of a sling   
   and it shall come to pass  when the lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee  and shall have appointed thee ruler over israel   
   that this shall be no grief unto thee  nor offence of heart unto my lord  either that thou hast shed blood causeless  or that my lord hath avenged himself  but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord  then remember thine handmaid   
    and david said to abigail  blessed  be  the lord god of israel  which sent thee this day to meet me   
   and blessed  be  thy advice  and blessed  be  thou  which hast kept me this day from coming to  shed  blood  and from avenging myself with mine own hand   
   for in very deed   as  the lord god of israel liveth  which hath kept me back from hurting thee  except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me  surely there had not been left unto nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall   
   so david received of her hand  that  which she had brought him  and said unto her  go up in peace to thine house  see  i have hearkened to thy voice  and have accepted thy person   
    and abigail came to nabal  and  behold  he held a feast in his house  like the feast of a king  and nabal s heart  was  merry within him  for he  was  very drunken  wherefore she told him nothing  less or more  until the morning light   
   but it came to pass in the morning  when the wine was gone out of nabal  and his wife had told him these things  that his heart died within him  and he became  as  a stone   
   and it came to pass about ten days  after   that the lord smote nabal  that he died   
   and when david heard that nabal was dead  he said  blessed  be  the lord  that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabal  and hath kept his servant from evil  for the lord hath returned the wickedness of nabal upon his own head  and david sent and communed with abigail  to take her to him to wife   
   and when the servants of david were come to abigail to carmel  they spake unto her  saying  david sent us unto thee  to take thee to him to wife   
   and she arose  and bowed herself on  her  face to the earth  and said  behold   let  thine handmaid  be  a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord   
   and abigail hasted  and arose  and rode upon an ass  with five damsels of hers that went after her  and she went after the messengers of david  and became his wife   
   david also took ahinoam of jezreel  and they were also both of them his wives   
   but saul had given michal his daughter  david s wife  to phalti the son of laish  which  was  of gallim   
  samuel    
   and the ziphites came unto saul to gibeah  saying  doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah   which is  before jeshimon   
  then saul arose  and went down to the wilderness of ziph  having three thousand chosen men of israel with him  to seek david in the wilderness of ziph   
  and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah  which  is  before jeshimon  by the way  but david abode in the wilderness  and he saw that saul came after him into the wilderness   
  david therefore sent out spies  and understood that saul was come in very deed   
  and david arose  and came to the place where saul had pitched  and david beheld the place where saul lay  and abner the son of ner  the captain of his host  and saul lay in the trench  and the people pitched round about him   
   then answered david and said to ahimelech the hittite  and to abishai the son of zeruiah  brother to joab  saying  who will go down with me to saul to the camp  and abishai said  i will go down with thee   
  so david and abishai came to the people by night  and  behold  saul lay sleeping within the trench  and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster  but abner and the people lay round about him   
  then said abishai to david  god hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day  now therefore let me smite him  i pray thee  with the spear even to the earth at once  and i will not  smite  him the second time   
  and david said to abishai  destroy him not  for who can stretch forth his hand against the lord s anointed  and be guiltless   
   david said furthermore   as  the lord liveth  the lord shall smite him  or his day shall come to die  or he shall descend into battle  and perish   
   the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against the lord s anointed  but  i pray thee  take thou now the spear that  is  at his bolster  and the cruse of water  and let us go   
   so david took the spear and the cruse of water from saul s bolster  and they gat them away  and no man saw  it   nor knew  it   neither awaked  for they  were  all asleep  because a deep sleep from the lord was fallen upon them   
    then david went over to the other side  and stood on the top of an hill afar off  a great space  being  between them   
   and david cried to the people  and to abner the son of ner  saying  answerest thou not  abner  then abner answered and said  who  art  thou  that  criest to the king   
   and david said to abner   art  not thou a  valiant  man  and who  is  like to thee in israel  wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king  for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord   
   this thing  is  not good that thou hast done   as  the lord liveth  ye  are  worthy to die  because ye have not kept your master  the lord s anointed  and now see where the king s spear  is   and the cruse of water that  was  at his bolster   
   and saul knew david s voice  and said   is  this thy voice  my son david  and david said   it is  my voice  my lord  o king   
   and he said  wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant  for what have i done  or what evil  is  in mine hand   
   now therefore  i pray thee  let my lord the king hear the words of his servant  if the lord have stirred thee up against me  let him accept an offering  but if  they be  the children of men  cursed  be  they before the lord  for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the lord  saying  go  serve other gods   
   now therefore  let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the lord  for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea  as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains   
    then said saul  i have sinned  return  my son david  for i will no more do thee harm  because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day  behold  i have played the fool  and have erred exceedingly   
   and david answered and said  behold the king s spear  and let one of the young men come over and fetch it   
   the lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness  for the lord delivered thee into  my  hand to day  but i would not stretch forth mine hand against the lord s anointed   
   and  behold  as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes  so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the lord  and let him deliver me out of all tribulation   
   then saul said to david  blessed  be  thou  my son david  thou shalt both do great  things   and also shalt still prevail  so david went on his way  and saul returned to his place   
  samuel    
   and david said in his heart  i shall now perish one day by the hand of saul   there is  nothing better for me than that i should speedily escape into the land of the philistines  and saul shall despair of me  to seek me any more in any coast of israel  so shall i escape out of his hand   
  and david arose  and he passed over with the six hundred men that  were  with him unto achish  the son of maoch  king of gath   
  and david dwelt with achish at gath  he and his men  every man with his household   even  david with his two wives  ahinoam the jezreelitess  and abigail the carmelitess  nabal s wife   
  and it was told saul that david was fled to gath  and he sought no more again for him   
  and david said unto achish  if i have now found grace in thine eyes  let them give me a place in some town in the country  that i may dwell there  for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee   
  then achish gave him ziklag that day  wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of judah unto this day   
  and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistines was a full year and four months   
   and david and his men went up  and invaded the geshurites  and the gezrites  and the amalekites  for those  nations were  of old the inhabitants of the land  as thou goest to shur  even unto the land of egypt   
  and david smote the land  and left neither man nor woman alive  and took away the sheep  and the oxen  and the asses  and the camels  and the apparel  and returned  and came to achish   
   and achish said  whither have ye made a road to day  and david said  against the south of judah  and against the south of the jerahmeelites  and against the south of the kenites   
   and david saved neither man nor woman alive  to bring  tidings  to gath  saying  lest they should tell on us  saying  so did david  and so  will be  his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the philistines   
   and achish believed david  saying  he hath made his people israel utterly to abhor him  therefore he shall be my servant for ever   
  samuel    
   and it came to pass in those days  that the philistines gathered their armies together for warfare  to fight with israel  and achish said unto david  know thou assuredly  that thou shalt go out with me to battle  thou and thy men   
  and david said to achish  surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do  and achish said to david  therefore will i make thee keeper of mine head for ever   
  now samuel was dead  and all israel had lamented him  and buried him in ramah  even in his own city  and saul had put away those that had familiar spirits  and the wizards  out of the land   
  and the philistines gathered themselves together  and came and pitched in shunem  and saul gathered all israel together  and they pitched in gilboa   
  and when saul saw the host of the philistines  he was afraid  and his heart greatly trembled   
  and when saul enquired of the lord  the lord answered him not  neither by dreams  nor by urim  nor by prophets   
   then said saul unto his servants  seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit  that i may go to her  and enquire of her  and his servants said to him  behold   there is  a woman that hath a familiar spirit at endor   
  and saul disguised himself  and put on other raiment  and he went  and two men with him  and they came to the woman by night  and he said  i pray thee  divine unto me by the familiar spirit  and bring me  him  up  whom i shall name unto thee   
  and the woman said unto him  behold  thou knowest what saul hath done  how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits  and the wizards  out of the land  wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life  to cause me to die   
   and saul sware to her by the lord  saying   as  the lord liveth  there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing   
   then said the woman  whom shall i bring up unto thee  and he said  bring me up samuel   
   and when the woman saw samuel  she cried with a loud voice  and the woman spake to saul  saying  why hast thou deceived me  for thou  art  saul   
   and the king said unto her  be not afraid  for what sawest thou  and the woman said unto saul  i saw gods ascending out of the earth   
   and he said unto her  what form  is  he of  and she said  an old man cometh up  and he  is  covered with a mantle  and saul perceived that it  was  samuel  and he stooped with  his  face to the ground  and bowed himself   
    and samuel said to saul  why hast thou disquieted me  to bring me up  and saul answered  i am sore distressed  for the philistines make war against me  and god is departed from me  and answereth me no more  neither by prophets  nor by dreams  therefore i have called thee  that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do   
   then said samuel  wherefore then dost thou ask of me  seeing the lord is departed from thee  and is become thine enemy   
   and the lord hath done to him  as he spake by me  for the lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand  and given it to thy neighbour   even  to david   
   because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord  nor executedst his fierce wrath upon amalek  therefore hath the lord done this thing unto thee this day   
   moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into the hand of the philistines  and to morrow  shalt  thou and thy sons  be  with me  the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand of the philistines   
    then saul fell straightway all along on the earth  and was sore afraid  because of the words of samuel  and there was no strength in him  for he had eaten no bread all the day  nor all the night   
   and the woman came unto saul  and saw that he was sore troubled  and said unto him  behold  thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice  and i have put my life in my hand  and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me   
   now therefore  i pray thee  hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid  and let me set a morsel of bread before thee  and eat  that thou mayest have strength  when thou goest on thy way   
   but he refused  and said  i will not eat  but his servants  together with the woman  compelled him  and he hearkened unto their voice  so he arose from the earth  and sat upon the bed   
   and the woman had a fat calf in the house  and she hasted  and killed it  and took flour  and kneaded  it   and did bake unleavened bread thereof   
   and she brought  it  before saul  and before his servants  and they did eat  then they rose up  and went away that night   
  samuel    
   now the philistines gathered together all their armies to aphek  and the israelites pitched by a fountain which  is  in jezreel   
  and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds  and by thousands  but david and his men passed on in the rereward with achish   
  then said the princes of the philistines  what  do  these hebrews  here   and achish said unto the princes of the philistines   is  not this david  the servant of saul the king of israel  which hath been with me these days  or these years  and i have found no fault in him since he fell  unto me  unto this day   
  and the princes of the philistines were wroth with him  and the princes of the philistines said unto him  make this fellow return  that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him  and let him not go down with us to battle  lest in the battle he be an adversary to us  for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master   should it  not  be  with the heads of these men   
   is  not this david  of whom they sang one to another in dances  saying  saul slew his thousands  and david his ten thousands   
   then achish called david  and said unto him  surely   as  the lord liveth  thou hast been upright  and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host  is  good in my sight  for i have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day  nevertheless the lords favour thee not   
  wherefore now return  and go in peace  that thou displease not the lords of the philistines   
  and david said unto achish  but what have i done  and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as i have been with thee unto this day  that i may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king   
  and achish answered and said to david  i know that thou  art  good in my sight  as an angel of god  notwithstanding the princes of the philistines have said  he shall not go up with us to the battle   
   wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master s servants that are come with thee  and as soon as ye be up early in the morning  and have light  depart   
   so david and his men rose up early to depart in the morning  to return into the land of the philistines  and the philistines went up to jezreel   
  samuel    
   and it came to pass  when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day  that the amalekites had invaded the south  and ziklag  and smitten ziklag  and burned it with fire   
  and had taken the women captives  that  were  therein  they slew not any  either great or small  but carried  them  away  and went on their way   
  so david and his men came to the city  and  behold   it was  burned with fire  and their wives  and their sons  and their daughters  were taken captives   
  then david and the people that  were  with him lifted up their voice and wept  until they had no more power to weep   
  and david s two wives were taken captives  ahinoam the jezreelitess  and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite   
  and david was greatly distressed  for the people spake of stoning him  because the soul of all the people was grieved  every man for his sons and for his daughters  but david encouraged himself in the lord his god   
   and david said to abiathar the priest  ahimelech s son  i pray thee  bring me hither the ephod  and abiathar brought thither the ephod to david   
  and david enquired at the lord  saying  shall i pursue after this troop  shall i overtake them  and he answered him  pursue  for thou shalt surely overtake  them   and without fail recover  all    
  so david went  he and the six hundred men that  were  with him  and came to the brook besor  where those that were left behind stayed   
   but david pursued  he and four hundred men  for two hundred abode behind  which were so faint that they could not go over the brook besor   
   and they found an egyptian in the field  and brought him to david  and gave him bread  and he did eat  and they made him drink water   
   and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs  and two clusters of raisins  and when he had eaten  his spirit came again to him  for he had eaten no bread  nor drunk  any  water  three days and three nights   
   and david said unto him  to whom  belongest  thou  and whence  art  thou  and he said  i  am  a young man of egypt  servant to an amalekite  and my master left me  because three days agone i fell sick   
   we made an invasion  upon  the south of the cherethites  and upon  the coast  which  belongeth  to judah  and upon the south of caleb  and we burned ziklag with fire   
   and david said to him  canst thou bring me down to this company  and he said  swear unto me by god  that thou wilt neither kill me  nor deliver me into the hands of my master  and i will bring thee down to this company   
   and when he had brought him down  behold   they were  spread abroad upon all the earth  eating and drinking  and dancing  because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the philistines  and out of the land of judah   
   and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day  and there escaped not a man of them  save four hundred young men  which rode upon camels  and fled   
   and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried away  and david rescued his two wives   
   and there was nothing lacking to them  neither small nor great  neither sons nor daughters  neither spoil  nor any  thing  that they had taken to them  david recovered all   
   and david took all the flocks and the herds   which  they drave before those  other  cattle  and said  this  is  david s spoil   
    and david came to the two hundred men  which were so faint that they could not follow david  whom they had made also to abide at the brook besor  and they went forth to meet david  and to meet the people that  were  with him  and when david came near to the people  he saluted them   
   then answered all the wicked men and  men  of belial  of those that went with david  and said  because they went not with us  we will not give them  ought  of the spoil that we have recovered  save to every man his wife and his children  that they may lead  them  away  and depart   
   then said david  ye shall not do so  my brethren  with that which the lord hath given us  who hath preserved us  and delivered the company that came against us into our hand   
   for who will hearken unto you in this matter  but as his part  is  that goeth down to the battle  so  shall  his part  be  that tarrieth by the stuff  they shall part alike   
   and it was  so  from that day forward  that he made it a statute and an ordinance for israel unto this day   
   and when david came to ziklag  he sent of the spoil unto the elders of judah   even  to his friends  saying  behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the lord   
   to  them  which  were  in bethel  and to  them  which  were  in south ramoth  and to  them  which  were  in jattir   
   and to  them  which  were  in aroer  and to  them  which  were  in siphmoth  and to  them  which  were  in eshtemoa   
   and to  them  which  were  in rachal  and to  them  which  were  in the cities of the jerahmeelites  and to  them  which  were  in the cities of the kenites   
   and to  them  which  were  in hormah  and to  them  which  were  in chorashan  and to  them  which  were  in athach   
   and to  them  which  were  in hebron  and to all the places where david himself and his men were wont to haunt   
  samuel    
   now the philistines fought against israel  and the men of israel fled from before the philistines  and fell down slain in mount gilboa   
  and the philistines followed hard upon saul and upon his sons  and the philistines slew jonathan  and abinadab  and malchishua  saul s sons   
  and the battle went sore against saul  and the archers hit him  and he was sore wounded of the archers   
  then said saul unto his armourbearer  draw thy sword  and thrust me through therewith  lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through  and abuse me  but his armourbearer would not  for he was sore afraid  therefore saul took a sword  and fell upon it   
  and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead  he fell likewise upon his sword  and died with him   
  so saul died  and his three sons  and his armourbearer  and all his men  that same day together   
  and when the men of israel that  were  on the other side of the valley  and  they  that  were  on the other side jordan  saw that the men of israel fled  and that saul and his sons were dead  they forsook the cities  and fled  and the philistines came and dwelt in them   
   and it came to pass on the morrow  when the philistines came to strip the slain  that they found saul and his three sons fallen in mount gilboa   
  and they cut off his head  and stripped off his armour  and sent into the land of the philistines round about  to publish  it in  the house of their idols  and among the people   
   and they put his armour in the house of ashtaroth  and they fastened his body to the wall of bethshan   
   and when the inhabitants of jabeshgilead heard of that which the philistines had done to saul   
   all the valiant men arose  and went all night  and took the body of saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of bethshan  and came to jabesh  and burnt them there   
   and they took their bones  and buried  them  under a tree at jabesh  and fasted seven days

   now it came to pass after the death of saul  when david was returned from the slaughter of the amalekites  and david had abode two days in ziklag   
  it came even to pass on the third day  that  behold  a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes rent  and earth upon his head  and  so  it was  when he came to david  that he fell to the earth  and did obeisance   
  and david said unto him  from whence comest thou  and he said unto him  out of the camp of israel am i escaped   
  and david said unto him  how went the matter  i pray thee  tell me  and he answered  that the people are fled from the battle  and many of the people also are fallen and dead  and saul and jonathan his son are dead also   
  and david said unto the young man that told him  how knowest thou that saul and jonathan his son be dead   
  and the young man that told him said  as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa  behold  saul leaned upon his spear  and  lo  the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him   
  and when he looked behind him  he saw me  and called unto me  and i answered  here  am  i   
  and he said unto me  who  art  thou  and i answered him  i  am  an amalekite   
  he said unto me again  stand  i pray thee  upon me  and slay me  for anguish is come upon me  because my life  is  yet whole in me   
   so i stood upon him  and slew him  because i was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen  and i took the crown that  was  upon his head  and the bracelet that  was  on his arm  and have brought them hither unto my lord   
    then david took hold on his clothes  and rent them  and likewise all the men that  were  with him   
   and they mourned  and wept  and fasted until even  for saul  and for jonathan his son  and for the people of the lord  and for the house of israel  because they were fallen by the sword   
   and david said unto the young man that told him  whence  art  thou  and he answered  i  am  the son of a stranger  an amalekite   
   and david said unto him  how wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the lord s anointed   
   and david called one of the young men  and said  go near   and  fall upon him  and he smote him that he died   
   and david said unto him  thy blood  be  upon thy head  for thy mouth hath testified against thee  saying  i have slain the lord s anointed   
    and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over jonathan his son   
    also he bade them teach the children of judah  the use of  the bow  behold   it is  written in the book of jasher    
   the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places  how are the mighty fallen   
   tell  it  not in gath  publish  it  not in the streets of askelon  lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice  lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph   
   ye mountains of gilboa   let there be  no dew  neither  let there be  rain  upon you  nor fields of offerings  for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away  the shield of saul   as though he had  not  been  anointed with oil   
   from the blood of the slain  from the fat of the mighty  the bow of jonathan turned not back  and the sword of saul returned not empty   
   saul and jonathan  were  lovely and pleasant in their lives  and in their death they were not divided  they were swifter than eagles  they were stronger than lions   
   ye daughters of israel  weep over saul  who clothed you in scarlet  with  other  delights  who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel   
   how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle  o jonathan   thou wast  slain in thine high places   
   i am distressed for thee  my brother jonathan  very pleasant hast thou been unto me  thy love to me was wonderful  passing the love of women   
   how are the mighty fallen  and the weapons of war perished   
  samuel   
   and it came to pass after this  that david enquired of the lord  saying  shall i go up into any of the cities of judah  and the lord said unto him  go up  and david said  whither shall i go up  and he said  unto hebron   
  so david went up thither  and his two wives also  ahinoam the jezreelitess  and abigail nabal s wife the carmelite   
  and his men that  were  with him did david bring up  every man with his household  and they dwelt in the cities of hebron   
  and the men of judah came  and there they anointed david king over the house of judah  and they told david  saying   that  the men of jabeshgilead  were they  that buried saul   
  and david sent messengers unto the men of jabeshgilead  and said unto them  blessed  be  ye of the lord  that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord   even  unto saul  and have buried him   
  and now the lord shew kindness and truth unto you  and i also will requite you this kindness  because ye have done this thing   
  therefore now let your hands be strengthened  and be ye valiant  for your master saul is dead  and also the house of judah have anointed me king over them   
   but abner the son of ner  captain of saul s host  took ishbosheth the son of saul  and brought him over to mahanaim   
  and made him king over gilead  and over the ashurites  and over jezreel  and over ephraim  and over benjamin  and over all israel   
   ishbosheth saul s son  was  forty years old when he began to reign over israel  and reigned two years  but the house of judah followed david   
   and the time that david was king in hebron over the house of judah was seven years and six months   
   and abner the son of ner  and the servants of ishbosheth the son of saul  went out from mahanaim to gibeon   
   and joab the son of zeruiah  and the servants of david  went out  and met together by the pool of gibeon  and they sat down  the one on the one side of the pool  and the other on the other side of the pool   
   and abner said to joab  let the young men now arise  and play before us  and joab said  let them arise   
   then there arose and went over by number twelve of benjamin  which  pertained  to ishbosheth the son of saul  and twelve of the servants of david   
   and they caught every one his fellow by the head  and  thrust  his sword in his fellow s side  so they fell down together  wherefore that place was called helkathhazzurim  which  is  in gibeon   
   and there was a very sore battle that day  and abner was beaten  and the men of israel  before the servants of david   
    and there were three sons of zeruiah there  joab  and abishai  and asahel  and asahel  was as  light of foot as a wild roe   
   and asahel pursued after abner  and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following abner   
   then abner looked behind him  and said   art  thou asahel  and he answered  i  am    
   and abner said to him  turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left  and lay thee hold on one of the young men  and take thee his armour  but asahel would not turn aside from following of him   
   and abner said again to asahel  turn thee aside from following me  wherefore should i smite thee to the ground  how then should i hold up my face to joab thy brother   
   howbeit he refused to turn aside  wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth  rib   that the spear came out behind him  and he fell down there  and died in the same place  and it came to pass   that  as many as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still   
   joab also and abishai pursued after abner  and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of ammah  that  lieth  before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon   
    and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after abner  and became one troop  and stood on the top of an hill   
   then abner called to joab  and said  shall the sword devour for ever  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end  how long shall it be then  ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren   
   and joab said   as  god liveth  unless thou hadst spoken  surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother   
   so joab blew a trumpet  and all the people stood still  and pursued after israel no more  neither fought they any more   
   and abner and his men walked all that night through the plain  and passed over jordan  and went through all bithron  and they came to mahanaim   
   and joab returned from following abner  and when he had gathered all the people together  there lacked of david s servants nineteen men and asahel   
   but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin  and of abner s men   so that  three hundred and threescore men died   
   and they took up asahel  and buried him in the sepulchre of his father  which  was in  bethlehem  and joab and his men went all night  and they came to hebron at break of day   
  samuel   
   now there was long war between the house of saul and the house of david  but david waxed stronger and stronger  and the house of saul waxed weaker and weaker   
  and unto david were sons born in hebron  and his firstborn was amnon  of ahinoam the jezreelitess   
  and his second  chileab  of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite  and the third  absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur   
  and the fourth  adonijah the son of haggith  and the fifth  shephatiah the son of abital   
  and the sixth  ithream  by eglah david s wife  these were born to david in hebron   
  and it came to pass  while there was war between the house of saul and the house of david  that abner made himself strong for the house of saul   
   and saul had a concubine  whose name  was  rizpah  the daughter of aiah  and  ishbosheth  said to abner  wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father s concubine   
  then was abner very wroth for the words of ishbosheth  and said   am  i a dog s head  which against judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of saul thy father  to his brethren  and to his friends  and have not delivered thee into the hand of david  that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman   
  so do god to abner  and more also  except  as the lord hath sworn to david  even so i do to him   
   to translate the kingdom from the house of saul  and to set up the throne of david over israel and over judah  from dan even to beersheba   
   and he could not answer abner a word again  because he feared him   
   and abner sent messengers to david on his behalf  saying  whose  is  the land  saying  also   make thy league with me  and  behold  my hand  shall be  with thee  to bring about all israel unto thee   
   and he said  well  i will make a league with thee  but one thing i require of thee  that is  thou shalt not see my face  except thou first bring michal saul s daughter  when thou comest to see my face   
   and david sent messengers to ishbosheth saul s son  saying  deliver  me  my wife michal  which i espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the philistines   
   and ishbosheth sent  and took her from  her  husband   even  from phaltiel the son of laish   
   and her husband went with her along weeping behind her to bahurim  then said abner unto him  go  return  and he returned   
   and abner had communication with the elders of israel  saying  ye sought for david in times past  to be  king over you   
   now then do  it   for the lord hath spoken of david  saying  by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the philistines  and out of the hand of all their enemies   
   and abner also spake in the ears of benjamin  and abner went also to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to israel  and that seemed good to the whole house of benjamin   
   so abner came to david to hebron  and twenty men with him  and david made abner and the men that  were  with him a feast   
   and abner said unto david  i will arise and go  and will gather all israel unto my lord the king  that they may make a league with thee  and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth  and david sent abner away  and he went in peace   
    and  behold  the servants of david and joab came from  pursuing  a troop  and brought in a great spoil with them  but abner  was  not with david in hebron  for he had sent him away  and he was gone in peace   
   when joab and all the host that  was  with him were come  they told joab  saying  abner the son of ner came to the king  and he hath sent him away  and he is gone in peace   
   then joab came to the king  and said  what hast thou done  behold  abner came unto thee  why  is  it  that  thou hast sent him away  and he is quite gone   
   thou knowest abner the son of ner  that he came to deceive thee  and to know thy going out and thy coming in  and to know all that thou doest   
   and when joab was come out from david  he sent messengers after abner  which brought him again from the well of sirah  but david knew  it  not   
   and when abner was returned to hebron  joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly  and smote him there under the fifth  rib   that he died  for the blood of asahel his brother   
   and afterward when david heard  it   he said  i and my kingdom  are  guiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of ner   
   let it rest on the head of joab  and on all his father s house  and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath an issue  or that is a leper  or that leaneth on a staff  or that falleth on the sword  or that lacketh bread   
   so joab and abishai his brother slew abner  because he had slain their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle   
   and david said to joab  and to all the people that  were  with him  rend your clothes  and gird you with sackcloth  and mourn before abner  and king david  himself  followed the bier   
   and they buried abner in hebron  and the king lifted up his voice  and wept at the grave of abner  and all the people wept   
   and the king lamented over abner  and said  died abner as a fool dieth   
   thy hands  were  not bound  nor thy feet put into fetters  as a man falleth before wicked men   so  fellest thou  and all the people wept again over him   
   and when all the people came to cause david to eat meat while it was yet day  david sware  saying  so do god to me  and more also  if i taste bread  or ought else  till the sun be down   
   and all the people took notice  of it   and it pleased them  as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people   
   for all the people and all israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay abner the son of ner   
   and the king said unto his servants  know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in israel   
   and i  am  this day weak  though anointed king  and these men the sons of zeruiah  be  too hard for me  the lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness   
  samuel   
   and when saul s son heard that abner was dead in hebron  his hands were feeble  and all the israelites were troubled   
  and saul s son had two men  that were  captains of bands  the name of the one  was  baanah  and the name of the other rechab  the sons of rimmon a beerothite  of the children of benjamin   for beeroth also was reckoned to benjamin   
  and the beerothites fled to gittaim  and were sojourners there until this day    
  and jonathan  saul s son  had a son  that was  lame of  his  feet  he was five years old when the tidings came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel  and his nurse took him up  and fled  and it came to pass  as she made haste to flee  that he fell  and became lame  and his name  was  mephibosheth   
  and the sons of rimmon the beerothite  rechab and baanah  went  and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth  who lay on a bed at noon   
  and they came thither into the midst of the house   as though  they would have fetched wheat  and they smote him under the fifth  rib   and rechab and baanah his brother escaped   
  for when they came into the house  he lay on his bed in his bedchamber  and they smote him  and slew him  and beheaded him  and took his head  and gat them away through the plain all night   
  and they brought the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron  and said to the king  behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine enemy  which sought thy life  and the lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of saul  and of his seed   
   and david answered rechab and baanah his brother  the sons of rimmon the beerothite  and said unto them   as  the lord liveth  who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity   
   when one told me  saying  behold  saul is dead  thinking to have brought good tidings  i took hold of him  and slew him in ziklag  who  thought  that i would have given him a reward for his tidings   
   how much more  when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed  shall i not therefore now require his blood of your hand  and take you away from the earth   
   and david commanded his young men  and they slew them  and cut off their hands and their feet  and hanged  them  up over the pool in hebron  but they took the head of ishbosheth  and buried  it  in the sepulchre of abner in hebron   
  samuel   
   then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron  and spake  saying  behold  we  are  thy bone and thy flesh   
  also in time past  when saul was king over us  thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel  and the lord said to thee  thou shalt feed my people israel  and thou shalt be a captain over israel   
  so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron  and king david made a league with them in hebron before the lord  and they anointed david king over israel   
  david  was  thirty years old when he began to reign   and  he reigned forty years   
  in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months  and in jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah   
   and the king and his men went to jerusalem unto the jebusites  the inhabitants of the land  which spake unto david  saying  except thou take away the blind and the lame  thou shalt not come in hither  thinking  david cannot come in hither   
  nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion  the same  is  the city of david   
  and david said on that day  whosoever getteth up to the gutter  and smiteth the jebusites  and the lame and the blind   that are  hated of david s soul   he shall be chief and captain   wherefore they said  the blind and the lame shall not come into the house   
  so david dwelt in the fort  and called it the city of david  and david built round about from millo and inward   
   and david went on  and grew great  and the lord god of hosts  was  with him   
    and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david  and cedar trees  and carpenters  and masons  and they built david an house   
   and david perceived that the lord had established him king over israel  and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israel s sake   
   and david took  him  more concubines and wives out of jerusalem  after he was come from hebron  and there were yet sons and daughters born to david   
   and these  be  the names of those that were born unto him in jerusalem  shammua  and shobab  and nathan  and solomon   
   ibhar also  and elishua  and nepheg  and japhia   
   and elishama  and eliada  and eliphalet   
    but when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king over israel  all the philistines came up to seek david  and david heard  of it   and went down to the hold   
   the philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim   
   and david enquired of the lord  saying  shall i go up to the philistines  wilt thou deliver them into mine hand  and the lord said unto david  go up  for i will doubtless deliver the philistines into thine hand   
   and david came to baalperazim  and david smote them there  and said  the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me  as the breach of waters  therefore he called the name of that place baalperazim   
   and there they left their images  and david and his men burned them   
   and the philistines came up yet again  and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim   
   and when david enquired of the lord  he said  thou shalt not go up   but  fetch a compass behind them  and come upon them over against the mulberry trees   
   and let it be  when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees  that then thou shalt bestir thyself  for then shall the lord go out before thee  to smite the host of the philistines   
   and david did so  as the lord had commanded him  and smote the philistines from geba until thou come to gazer   
  samuel   
   again  david gathered together all  the  chosen  men  of israel  thirty thousand   
  and david arose  and went with all the people that  were  with him from baale of judah  to bring up from thence the ark of god  whose name is called by the name of the lord of hosts that dwelleth  between  the cherubims   
  and they set the ark of god upon a new cart  and brought it out of the house of abinadab that  was  in gibeah  and uzzah and ahio  the sons of abinadab  drave the new cart   
  and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which  was  at gibeah  accompanying the ark of god  and ahio went before the ark   
  and david and all the house of israel played before the lord on all manner of  instruments made of  fir wood  even on harps  and on psalteries  and on timbrels  and on cornets  and on cymbals   
   and when they came to nachon s threshingfloor  uzzah put forth  his hand  to the ark of god  and took hold of it  for the oxen shook  it    
  and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah  and god smote him there for  his  error  and there he died by the ark of god   
  and david was displeased  because the lord had made a breach upon uzzah  and he called the name of the place perezuzzah to this day   
  and david was afraid of the lord that day  and said  how shall the ark of the lord come to me   
   so david would not remove the ark of the lord unto him into the city of david  but david carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite   
   and the ark of the lord continued in the house of obededom the gittite three months  and the lord blessed obededom  and all his household   
    and it was told king david  saying  the lord hath blessed the house of obededom  and all that  pertaineth  unto him  because of the ark of god  so david went and brought up the ark of god from the house of obededom into the city of david with gladness   
   and it was  so   that when they that bare the ark of the lord had gone six paces  he sacrificed oxen and fatlings   
   and david danced before the lord with all  his  might  and david  was  girded with a linen ephod   
   so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the lord with shouting  and with the sound of the trumpet   
   and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david  michal saul s daughter looked through a window  and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord  and she despised him in her heart   
   and they brought in the ark of the lord  and set it in his place  in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it  and david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord   
   and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings  he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts   
   and he dealt among all the people   even  among the whole multitude of israel  as well to the women as men  to every one a cake of bread  and a good piece  of flesh   and a flagon  of wine   so all the people departed every one to his house   
    then david returned to bless his household  and michal the daughter of saul came out to meet david  and said  how glorious was the king of israel to day  who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants  as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself   
   and david said unto michal   it was  before the lord  which chose me before thy father  and before all his house  to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord  over israel  therefore will i play before the lord   
   and i will yet be more vile than thus  and will be base in mine own sight  and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of  of them shall i be had in honour   
   therefore michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day of her death   
  samuel   
   and it came to pass  when the king sat in his house  and the lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies   
  that the king said unto nathan the prophet  see now  i dwell in an house of cedar  but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains   
  and nathan said to the king  go  do all that  is  in thine heart  for the lord  is  with thee   
   and it came to pass that night  that the word of the lord came unto nathan  saying   
  go and tell my servant david  thus saith the lord  shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in   
  whereas i have not dwelt in  any  house since the time that i brought up the children of israel out of egypt  even to this day  but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle   
  in all  the places  wherein i have walked with all the children of israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of israel  whom i commanded to feed my people israel  saying  why build ye not me an house of cedar   
  now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant david  thus saith the lord of hosts  i took thee from the sheepcote  from following the sheep  to be ruler over my people  over israel   
  and i was with thee whithersoever thou wentest  and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight  and have made thee a great name  like unto the name of the great  men  that  are  in the earth   
   moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel  and will plant them  that they may dwell in a place of their own  and move no more  neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more  as beforetime   
   and as since the time that i commanded judges  to be  over my people israel  and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies  also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house   
   and when thy days be fulfilled  and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers  i will set up thy seed after thee  which shall proceed out of thy bowels  and i will establish his kingdom   
   he shall build an house for my name  and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever   
   i will be his father  and he shall be my son  if he commit iniquity  i will chasten him with the rod of men  and with the stripes of the children of men   
   but my mercy shall not depart away from him  as i took  it  from saul  whom i put away before thee   
   and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee  thy throne shall be established for ever   
   according to all these words  and according to all this vision  so did nathan speak unto david   
    then went king david in  and sat before the lord  and he said  who  am  i  o lord god  and what  is  my house  that thou hast brought me hitherto   
   and this was yet a small thing in thy sight  o lord god  but thou hast spoken also of thy servant s house for a great while to come  and  is  this the manner of man  o lord god   
   and what can david say more unto thee  for thou  lord god  knowest thy servant   
   for thy word s sake  and according to thine own heart  hast thou done all these great things  to make thy servant know  them    
   wherefore thou art great  o lord god  for  there is  none like thee  neither  is there any  god beside thee  according to all that we have heard with our ears   
   and what one nation in the earth  is  like thy people   even  like israel  whom god went to redeem for a people to himself  and to make him a name  and to do for you great things and terrible  for thy land  before thy people  which thou redeemedst to thee from egypt   from  the nations and their gods   
   for thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people israel  to be  a people unto thee for ever  and thou  lord  art become their god   
   and now  o lord god  the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant  and concerning his house  establish  it  for ever  and do as thou hast said   
   and let thy name be magnified for ever  saying  the lord of hosts  is  the god over israel  and let the house of thy servant david be established before thee   
   for thou  o lord of hosts  god of israel  hast revealed to thy servant  saying  i will build thee an house  therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee   
   and now  o lord god  thou  art  that god  and thy words be true  and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant   
   therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant  that it may continue for ever before thee  for thou  o lord god  hast spoken  it   and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever   
  samuel   
   and after this it came to pass  that david smote the philistines  and subdued them  and david took methegammah out of the hand of the philistines   
  and he smote moab  and measured them with a line  casting them down to the ground  even with two lines measured he to put to death  and with one full line to keep alive  and  so  the moabites became david s servants   and  brought gifts   
  david smote also hadadezer  the son of rehob  king of zobah  as he went to recover his border at the river euphrates   
  and david took from him a thousand  chariots   and seven hundred horsemen  and twenty thousand footmen  and david houghed all the chariot  horses   but reserved of them  for  an hundred chariots   
  and when the syrians of damascus came to succour hadadezer king of zobah  david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men   
  then david put garrisons in syria of damascus  and the syrians became servants to david   and  brought gifts  and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went   
  and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadadezer  and brought them to jerusalem   
  and from betah  and from berothai  cities of hadadezer  king david took exceeding much brass   
   when toi king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the host of hadadezer   
   then toi sent joram his son unto king david  to salute him  and to bless him  because he had fought against hadadezer  and smitten him  for hadadezer had wars with toi  and  joram  brought with him vessels of silver  and vessels of gold  and vessels of brass   
   which also king david did dedicate unto the lord  with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued   
   of syria  and of moab  and of the children of ammon  and of the philistines  and of amalek  and of the spoil of hadadezer  son of rehob  king of zobah   
   and david gat  him  a name when he returned from smiting of the syrians in the valley of salt   being  eighteen thousand  men    
   and he put garrisons in edom  throughout all edom put he garrisons  and all they of edom became david s servants  and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went   
    and david reigned over all israel  and david executed judgment and justice unto all his people   
   and joab the son of zeruiah  was  over the host  and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud  was  recorder   
   and zadok the son of ahitub  and ahimelech the son of abiathar   were  the priests  and seraiah  was  the scribe   
   and benaiah the son of jehoiada  was over  both the cherethites and the pelethites  and david s sons were chief rulers   
  samuel   
   and david said  is there yet any that is left of the house of saul  that i may shew him kindness for jonathan s sake   
  and  there was  of the house of saul a servant whose name  was  ziba  and when they had called him unto david  the king said unto him   art  thou ziba  and he said  thy servant  is he    
  and the king said   is  there not yet any of the house of saul  that i may shew the kindness of god unto him  and ziba said unto the king  jonathan hath yet a son   which is  lame on  his  feet   
  and the king said unto him  where  is  he  and ziba said unto the king  behold  he  is  in the house of machir  the son of ammiel  in lodebar   
  then king david sent  and fetched him out of the house of machir  the son of ammiel  from lodebar   
  now when mephibosheth  the son of jonathan  the son of saul  was come unto david  he fell on his face  and did reverence  and david said  mephibosheth  and he answered  behold thy servant   
  and david said unto him  fear not  for i will surely shew thee kindness for jonathan thy father s sake  and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father  and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually   
  and he bowed himself  and said  what  is  thy servant  that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i  am    
   then the king called to ziba  saul s servant  and said unto him  i have given unto thy master s son all that pertained to saul and to all his house   
   thou therefore  and thy sons  and thy servants  shall till the land for him  and thou shalt bring in  the fruits   that thy master s son may have food to eat  but mephibosheth thy master s son shall eat bread alway at my table  now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants   
   then said ziba unto the king  according to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant  so shall thy servant do  as for mephibosheth   said the king   he shall eat at my table  as one of the king s sons   
   and mephibosheth had a young son  whose name  was  micha  and all that dwelt in the house of ziba  were  servants unto mephibosheth   
   so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem  for he did eat continually at the king s table  and was lame on both his feet   
  samuel    
   and it came to pass after this  that the king of the children of ammon died  and hanun his son reigned in his stead   
  then said david  i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash  as his father shewed kindness unto me  and david sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father  and david s servants came into the land of the children of ammon   
  and the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun their lord  thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father  that he hath sent comforters unto thee  hath not david  rather  sent his servants unto thee  to search the city  and to spy it out  and to overthrow it   
  wherefore hanun took david s servants  and shaved off the one half of their beards  and cut off their garments in the middle   even  to their buttocks  and sent them away   
  when they told  it  unto david  he sent to meet them  because the men were greatly ashamed  and the king said  tarry at jericho until your beards be grown  and  then  return   
   and when the children of ammon saw that they stank before david  the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of bethrehob  and the syrians of zoba  twenty thousand footmen  and of king maacah a thousand men  and of ishtob twelve thousand men   
  and when david heard of  it   he sent joab  and all the host of the mighty men   
  and the children of ammon came out  and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate  and the syrians of zoba  and of rehob  and ishtob  and maacah   were  by themselves in the field   
  when joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind  he chose of all the choice  men  of israel  and put  them  in array against the syrians   
   and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of abishai his brother  that he might put  them  in array against the children of ammon   
   and he said  if the syrians be too strong for me  then thou shalt help me  but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee  then i will come and help thee   
   be of good courage  and let us play the men for our people  and for the cities of our god  and the lord do that which seemeth him good   
   and joab drew nigh  and the people that  were  with him  unto the battle against the syrians  and they fled before him   
   and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled  then fled they also before abishai  and entered into the city  so joab returned from the children of ammon  and came to jerusalem   
    and when the syrians saw that they were smitten before israel  they gathered themselves together   
   and hadarezer sent  and brought out the syrians that  were  beyond the river  and they came to helam  and shobach the captain of the host of hadarezer  went  before them   
   and when it was told david  he gathered all israel together  and passed over jordan  and came to helam  and the syrians set themselves in array against david  and fought with him   
   and the syrians fled before israel  and david slew  the men of  seven hundred chariots of the syrians  and forty thousand horsemen  and smote shobach the captain of their host  who died there   
   and when all the kings  that were  servants to hadarezer saw that they were smitten before israel  they made peace with israel  and served them  so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon any more   
  samuel    
   and it came to pass  after the year was expired  at the time when kings go forth  to battle   that david sent joab  and his servants with him  and all israel  and they destroyed the children of ammon  and besieged rabbah  but david tarried still at jerusalem   
  and it came to pass in an eveningtide  that david arose from off his bed  and walked upon the roof of the king s house  and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself  and the woman  was  very beautiful to look upon   
  and david sent and enquired after the woman  and  one  said   is  not this bathsheba  the daughter of eliam  the wife of uriah the hittite   
  and david sent messengers  and took her  and she came in unto him  and he lay with her  for she was purified from her uncleanness  and she returned unto her house   
  and the woman conceived  and sent and told david  and said  i  am  with child   
   and david sent to joab   saying   send me uriah the hittite  and joab sent uriah to david   
  and when uriah was come unto him  david demanded  of him  how joab did  and how the people did  and how the war prospered   
  and david said to uriah  go down to thy house  and wash thy feet  and uriah departed out of the king s house  and there followed him a mess  of meat  from the king   
  but uriah slept at the door of the king s house with all the servants of his lord  and went not down to his house   
   and when they had told david  saying  uriah went not down unto his house  david said unto uriah  camest thou not from  thy  journey  why  then  didst thou not go down unto thine house   
   and uriah said unto david  the ark  and israel  and judah  abide in tents  and my lord joab  and the servants of my lord  are encamped in the open fields  shall i then go into mine house  to eat and to drink  and to lie with my wife   as  thou livest  and  as  thy soul liveth  i will not do this thing   
   and david said to uriah  tarry here to day also  and to morrow i will let thee depart  so uriah abode in jerusalem that day  and the morrow   
   and when david had called him  he did eat and drink before him  and he made him drunk  and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord  but went not down to his house   
    and it came to pass in the morning  that david wrote a letter to joab  and sent  it  by the hand of uriah   
   and he wrote in the letter  saying  set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle  and retire ye from him  that he may be smitten  and die   
   and it came to pass  when joab observed the city  that he assigned uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men  were    
   and the men of the city went out  and fought with joab  and there fell  some  of the people of the servants of david  and uriah the hittite died also   
   then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war   
   and charged the messenger  saying  when thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king   
   and if so be that the king s wrath arise  and he say unto thee  wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight  knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall   
   who smote abimelech the son of jerubbesheth  did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall  that he died in thebez  why went ye nigh the wall  then say thou  thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also   
   so the messenger went  and came and shewed david all that joab had sent him for   
   and the messenger said unto david  surely the men prevailed against us  and came out unto us into the field  and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate   
   and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants  and  some  of the king s servants be dead  and thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also   
   then david said unto the messenger  thus shalt thou say unto joab  let not this thing displease thee  for the sword devoureth one as well as another  make thy battle more strong against the city  and overthrow it  and encourage thou him   
   and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead  she mourned for her husband   
   and when the mourning was past  david sent and fetched her to his house  and she became his wife  and bare him a son  but the thing that david had done displeased the lord   
  samuel    
   and the lord sent nathan unto david  and he came unto him  and said unto him  there were two men in one city  the one rich  and the other poor   
  the rich  man  had exceeding many flocks and herds   
  but the poor  man  had nothing  save one little ewe lamb  which he had bought and nourished up  and it grew up together with him  and with his children  it did eat of his own meat  and drank of his own cup  and lay in his bosom  and was unto him as a daughter   
  and there came a traveller unto the rich man  and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd  to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him  but took the poor man s lamb  and dressed it for the man that was come to him   
  and david s anger was greatly kindled against the man  and he said to nathan   as  the lord liveth  the man that hath done this  thing  shall surely die   
  and he shall restore the lamb fourfold  because he did this thing  and because he had no pity   
  and nathan said to david  thou  art  the man  thus saith the lord god of israel  i anointed thee king over israel  and i delivered thee out of the hand of saul   
  and i gave thee thy master s house  and thy master s wives into thy bosom  and gave thee the house of israel and of judah  and if  that had been  too little  i would moreover have given unto thee such and such things   
  wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord  to do evil in his sight  thou hast killed uriah the hittite with the sword  and hast taken his wife  to be  thy wife  and hast slain him with the sword of the children of ammon   
   now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house  because thou hast despised me  and hast taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife   
   thus saith the lord  behold  i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house  and i will take thy wives before thine eyes  and give  them  unto thy neighbour  and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun   
   for thou didst  it  secretly  but i will do this thing before all israel  and before the sun   
   and david said unto nathan  i have sinned against the lord  and nathan said unto david  the lord also hath put away thy sin  thou shalt not die   
   howbeit  because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme  the child also  that is  born unto thee shall surely die   
    and nathan departed unto his house  and the lord struck the child that uriah s wife bare unto david  and it was very sick   
   david therefore besought god for the child  and david fasted  and went in  and lay all night upon the earth   
   and the elders of his house arose   and went  to him  to raise him up from the earth  but he would not  neither did he eat bread with them   
   and it came to pass on the seventh day  that the child died  and the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead  for they said  behold  while the child was yet alive  we spake unto him  and he would not hearken unto our voice  how will he then vex himself  if we tell him that the child is dead   
   but when david saw that his servants whispered  david perceived that the child was dead  therefore david said unto his servants  is the child dead  and they said  he is dead   
   then david arose from the earth  and washed  and anointed  himself   and changed his apparel  and came into the house of the lord  and worshipped  then he came to his own house  and when he required  they set bread before him  and he did eat   
   then said his servants unto him  what thing  is  this that thou hast done  thou didst fast and weep for the child   while it was  alive  but when the child was dead  thou didst rise and eat bread   
   and he said  while the child was yet alive  i fasted and wept  for i said  who can tell  whether  god will be gracious to me  that the child may live   
   but now he is dead  wherefore should i fast  can i bring him back again  i shall go to him  but he shall not return to me   
   and david comforted bathsheba his wife  and went in unto her  and lay with her  and she bare a son  and he called his name solomon  and the lord loved him   
   and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet  and he called his name jedidiah  because of the lord   
    and joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon  and took the royal city   
   and joab sent messengers to david  and said  i have fought against rabbah  and have taken the city of waters   
   now therefore gather the rest of the people together  and encamp against the city  and take it  lest i take the city  and it be called after my name   
   and david gathered all the people together  and went to rabbah  and fought against it  and took it   
   and he took their king s crown from off his head  the weight whereof  was  a talent of gold with the precious stones  and it was  set  on david s head  and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance   
   and he brought forth the people that  were  therein  and put  them  under saws  and under harrows of iron  and under axes of iron  and made them pass through the brickkiln  and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of ammon  so david and all the people returned unto jerusalem   
  samuel    
   and it came to pass after this  that absalom the son of david had a fair sister  whose name  was  tamar  and amnon the son of david loved her   
  and amnon was so vexed  that he fell sick for his sister tamar  for she  was  a virgin  and amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her   
  but amnon had a friend  whose name  was  jonadab  the son of shimeah david s brother  and jonadab  was  a very subtil man   
  and he said unto him  why  art  thou   being  the king s son  lean from day to day  wilt thou not tell me  and amnon said unto him  i love tamar  my brother absalom s sister   
  and jonadab said unto him  lay thee down on thy bed  and make thyself sick  and when thy father cometh to see thee  say unto him  i pray thee  let my sister tamar come  and give me meat  and dress the meat in my sight  that i may see  it   and eat  it  at her hand   
  so amnon lay down  and made himself sick  and when the king was come to see him  amnon said unto the king  i pray thee  let tamar my sister come  and make me a couple of cakes in my sight  that i may eat at her hand   
  then david sent home to tamar  saying  go now to thy brother amnon s house  and dress him meat   
  so tamar went to her brother amnon s house  and he was laid down  and she took flour  and kneaded  it   and made cakes in his sight  and did bake the cakes   
  and she took a pan  and poured  them  out before him  but he refused to eat  and amnon said  have out all men from me  and they went out every man from him   
   and amnon said unto tamar  bring the meat into the chamber  that i may eat of thine hand  and tamar took the cakes which she had made  and brought  them  into the chamber to amnon her brother   
   and when she had brought  them  unto him to eat  he took hold of her  and said unto her  come lie with me  my sister   
   and she answered him  nay  my brother  do not force me  for no such thing ought to be done in israel  do not thou this folly   
   and i  whither shall i cause my shame to go  and as for thee  thou shalt be as one of the fools in israel  now therefore  i pray thee  speak unto the king  for he will not withhold me from thee   
   howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice  but  being stronger than she  forced her  and lay with her   
   then amnon hated her exceedingly  so that the hatred wherewith he hated her  was  greater than the love wherewith he had loved her  and amnon said unto her  arise  be gone   
   and she said unto him   there is  no cause  this evil in sending me away  is  greater than the other that thou didst unto me  but he would not hearken unto her   
   then he called his servant that ministered unto him  and said  put now this  woman  out from me  and bolt the door after her   
   and  she had  a garment of divers colours upon her  for with such robes were the king s daughters  that were  virgins apparelled  then his servant brought her out  and bolted the door after her   
   and tamar put ashes on her head  and rent her garment of divers colours that  was  on her  and laid her hand on her head  and went on crying   
   and absalom her brother said unto her  hath amnon thy brother been with thee  but hold now thy peace  my sister  he  is  thy brother  regard not this thing  so tamar remained desolate in her brother absalom s house   
    but when king david heard of all these things  he was very wroth   
   and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor bad  for absalom hated amnon  because he had forced his sister tamar   
   and it came to pass after two full years  that absalom had sheepshearers in baalhazor  which  is  beside ephraim  and absalom invited all the king s sons   
   and absalom came to the king  and said  behold now  thy servant hath sheepshearers  let the king  i beseech thee  and his servants go with thy servant   
   and the king said to absalom  nay  my son  let us not all now go  lest we be chargeable unto thee  and he pressed him  howbeit he would not go  but blessed him   
   then said absalom  if not  i pray thee  let my brother amnon go with us  and the king said unto him  why should he go with thee   
   but absalom pressed him  that he let amnon and all the king s sons go with him   
   now absalom had commanded his servants  saying  mark ye now when amnon s heart is merry with wine  and when i say unto you  smite amnon  then kill him  fear not  have not i commanded you  be courageous  and be valiant   
   and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had commanded  then all the king s sons arose  and every man gat him up upon his mule  and fled   
    and it came to pass  while they were in the way  that tidings came to david  saying  absalom hath slain all the king s sons  and there is not one of them left   
   then the king arose  and tare his garments  and lay on the earth  and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent   
   and jonadab  the son of shimeah david s brother  answered and said  let not my lord suppose  that  they have slain all the young men the king s sons  for amnon only is dead  for by the appointment of absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister tamar   
   now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart  to think that all the king s sons are dead  for amnon only is dead   
   but absalom fled  and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes  and looked  and  behold  there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him   
   and jonadab said unto the king  behold  the king s sons come  as thy servant said  so it is   
   and it came to pass  as soon as he had made an end of speaking  that  behold  the king s sons came  and lifted up their voice and wept  and the king also and all his servants wept very sore   
   but absalom fled  and went to talmai  the son of ammihud  king of geshur  and  david  mourned for his son every day   
   so absalom fled  and went to geshur  and was there three years   
   and  the soul of  king david longed to go forth unto absalom  for he was comforted concerning amnon  seeing he was dead   
  samuel    
   now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the king s heart  was  toward absalom   
  and joab sent to tekoah  and fetched thence a wise woman  and said unto her  i pray thee  feign thyself to be a mourner  and put on now mourning apparel  and anoint not thyself with oil  but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead   
  and come to the king  and speak on this manner unto him  so joab put the words in her mouth   
  and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king  she fell on her face to the ground  and did obeisance  and said  help  o king   
  and the king said unto her  what aileth thee  and she answered  i  am  indeed a widow woman  and mine husband is dead   
  and thy handmaid had two sons  and they two strove together in the field  and  there was  none to part them  but the one smote the other  and slew him   
  and  behold  the whole family is risen against thine handmaid  and they said  deliver him that smote his brother  that we may kill him  for the life of his brother whom he slew  and we will destroy the heir also  and so they shall quench my coal which is left  and shall not leave to my husband  neither  name nor remainder upon the earth   
  and the king said unto the woman  go to thine house  and i will give charge concerning thee   
  and the woman of tekoah said unto the king  my lord  o king  the iniquity  be  on me  and on my father s house  and the king and his throne  be  guiltless   
   and the king said  whosoever saith  ought  unto thee  bring him to me  and he shall not touch thee any more   
   then said she  i pray thee  let the king remember the lord thy god  that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more  lest they destroy my son  and he said   as  the lord liveth  there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth   
   then the woman said  let thine handmaid  i pray thee  speak  one  word unto my lord the king  and he said  say on   
   and the woman said  wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of god  for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty  in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished   
   for we must needs die  and  are  as water spilt on the ground  which cannot be gathered up again  neither doth god respect  any  person  yet doth he devise means  that his banished be not expelled from him   
   now therefore that i am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king   it is  because the people have made me afraid  and thy handmaid said  i will now speak unto the king  it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid   
   for the king will hear  to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man  that would  destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of god   
   then thine handmaid said  the word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable  for as an angel of god  so  is  my lord the king to discern good and bad  therefore the lord thy god will be with thee   
   then the king answered and said unto the woman  hide not from me  i pray thee  the thing that i shall ask thee  and the woman said  let my lord the king now speak   
   and the king said   is not  the hand of joab with thee in all this  and the woman answered and said   as  thy soul liveth  my lord the king  none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken  for thy servant joab  he bade me  and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid   
   to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant joab done this thing  and my lord  is  wise  according to the wisdom of an angel of god  to know all  things  that  are  in the earth   
    and the king said unto joab  behold now  i have done this thing  go therefore  bring the young man absalom again   
   and joab fell to the ground on his face  and bowed himself  and thanked the king  and joab said  to day thy servant knoweth that i have found grace in thy sight  my lord  o king  in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant   
   so joab arose and went to geshur  and brought absalom to jerusalem   
   and the king said  let him turn to his own house  and let him not see my face  so absalom returned to his own house  and saw not the king s face   
   but in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom for his beauty  from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him   
   and when he polled his head   for it was at every year s end that he polled  it   because  the hair  was heavy on him  therefore he polled it   he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king s weight   
   and unto absalom there were born three sons  and one daughter  whose name  was  tamar  she was a woman of a fair countenance   
    so absalom dwelt two full years in jerusalem  and saw not the king s face   
   therefore absalom sent for joab  to have sent him to the king  but he would not come to him  and when he sent again the second time  he would not come   
   therefore he said unto his servants  see  joab s field is near mine  and he hath barley there  go and set it on fire  and absalom s servants set the field on fire   
   then joab arose  and came to absalom unto  his  house  and said unto him  wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire   
   and absalom answered joab  behold  i sent unto thee  saying  come hither  that i may send thee to the king  to say  wherefore am i come from geshur   it had been  good for me  to have been  there still  now therefore let me see the king s face  and if there be  any  iniquity in me  let him kill me   
   so joab came to the king  and told him  and when he had called for absalom  he came to the king  and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king  and the king kissed absalom   
  samuel    
   and it came to pass after this  that absalom prepared him chariots and horses  and fifty men to run before him   
  and absalom rose up early  and stood beside the way of the gate  and it was  so   that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment  then absalom called unto him  and said  of what city  art  thou  and he said  thy servant  is  of one of the tribes of israel   
  and absalom said unto him  see  thy matters  are  good and right  but  there is  no man  deputed  of the king to hear thee   
  absalom said moreover  oh that i were made judge in the land  that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me  and i would do him justice   
  and it was  so   that when any man came nigh  to him  to do him obeisance  he put forth his hand  and took him  and kissed him   
  and on this manner did absalom to all israel that came to the king for judgment  so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel   
   and it came to pass after forty years  that absalom said unto the king  i pray thee  let me go and pay my vow  which i have vowed unto the lord  in hebron   
  for thy servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in syria  saying  if the lord shall bring me again indeed to jerusalem  then i will serve the lord   
  and the king said unto him  go in peace  so he arose  and went to hebron   
   but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel  saying  as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet  then ye shall say  absalom reigneth in hebron   
   and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem   that were  called  and they went in their simplicity  and they knew not any thing   
   and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite  david s counsellor  from his city   even  from giloh  while he offered sacrifices  and the conspiracy was strong  for the people increased continually with absalom   
    and there came a messenger to david  saying  the hearts of the men of israel are after absalom   
   and david said unto all his servants that  were  with him at jerusalem  arise  and let us flee  for we shall not  else  escape from absalom  make speed to depart  lest he overtake us suddenly  and bring evil upon us  and smite the city with the edge of the sword   
   and the king s servants said unto the king  behold  thy servants  are ready to do  whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint   
   and the king went forth  and all his household after him  and the king left ten women   which were  concubines  to keep the house   
   and the king went forth  and all the people after him  and tarried in a place that was far off   
   and all his servants passed on beside him  and all the cherethites  and all the pelethites  and all the gittites  six hundred men which came after him from gath  passed on before the king   
   then said the king to ittai the gittite  wherefore goest thou also with us  return to thy place  and abide with the king  for thou  art  a stranger  and also an exile   
   whereas thou camest  but  yesterday  should i this day make thee go up and down with us  seeing i go whither i may  return thou  and take back thy brethren  mercy and truth  be  with thee   
   and ittai answered the king  and said   as  the lord liveth  and  as  my lord the king liveth  surely in what place my lord the king shall be  whether in death or life  even there also will thy servant be   
   and david said to ittai  go and pass over  and ittai the gittite passed over  and all his men  and all the little ones that  were  with him   
   and all the country wept with a loud voice  and all the people passed over  the king also himself passed over the brook kidron  and all the people passed over  toward the way of the wilderness   
    and lo zadok also  and all the levites  were  with him  bearing the ark of the covenant of god  and they set down the ark of god  and abiathar went up  until all the people had done passing out of the city   
   and the king said unto zadok  carry back the ark of god into the city  if i shall find favour in the eyes of the lord  he will bring me again  and shew me  both  it  and his habitation   
   but if he thus say  i have no delight in thee  behold   here am  i  let him do to me as seemeth good unto him   
   the king said also unto zadok the priest   art not  thou a seer  return into the city in peace  and your two sons with you  ahimaaz thy son  and jonathan the son of abiathar   
   see  i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness  until there come word from you to certify me   
   zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to jerusalem  and they tarried there   
   and david went up by the ascent of  mount  olivet  and wept as he went up  and had his head covered  and he went barefoot  and all the people that  was  with him covered every man his head  and they went up  weeping as they went up   
    and  one  told david  saying  ahithophel  is  among the conspirators with absalom  and david said  o lord  i pray thee  turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness   
   and it came to pass  that  when  david was come to the top  of the mount   where he worshipped god  behold  hushai the archite came to meet him with his coat rent  and earth upon his head   
   unto whom david said  if thou passest on with me  then thou shalt be a burden unto me   
   but if thou return to the city  and say unto absalom  i will be thy servant  o king   as  i  have been  thy father s servant hitherto  so  will  i now also  be  thy servant  then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of ahithophel   
   and  hast thou  not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priests  therefore it shall be   that  what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king s house  thou shalt tell  it  to zadok and abiathar the priests   
   behold   they have  there with them their two sons  ahimaaz zadok s  son   and jonathan abiathar s  son   and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear   
   so hushai david s friend came into the city  and absalom came into jerusalem   
  samuel    
   and when david was a little past the top  of the hill   behold  ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him  with a couple of asses saddled  and upon them two hundred  loaves  of bread  and an hundred bunches of raisins  and an hundred of summer fruits  and a bottle of wine   
  and the king said unto ziba  what meanest thou by these  and ziba said  the asses  be  for the king s household to ride on  and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat  and the wine  that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink   
  and the king said  and where  is  thy master s son  and ziba said unto the king  behold  he abideth at jerusalem  for he said  to day shall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father   
  then said the king to ziba  behold  thine  are  all that  pertained  unto mephibosheth  and ziba said  i humbly beseech thee  that  i may find grace in thy sight  my lord  o king   
   and when king david came to bahurim  behold  thence came out a man of the family of the house of saul  whose name  was  shimei  the son of gera  he came forth  and cursed still as he came   
  and he cast stones at david  and at all the servants of king david  and all the people and all the mighty men  were  on his right hand and on his left   
  and thus said shimei when he cursed  come out  come out  thou bloody man  and thou man of belial   
  the lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul  in whose stead thou hast reigned  and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son  and  behold  thou  art taken  in thy mischief  because thou  art  a bloody man   
  then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king  why should this dead dog curse my lord the king  let me go over  i pray thee  and take off his head   
   and the king said  what have i to do with you  ye sons of zeruiah  so let him curse  because the lord hath said unto him  curse david  who shall then say  wherefore hast thou done so   
   and david said to abishai  and to all his servants  behold  my son  which came forth of my bowels  seeketh my life  how much more now  may this  benjamite  do it   let him alone  and let him curse  for the lord hath bidden him   
   it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction  and that the lord will requite me good for his cursing this day   
   and as david and his men went by the way  shimei went along on the hill s side over against him  and cursed as he went  and threw stones at him  and cast dust   
   and the king  and all the people that  were  with him  came weary  and refreshed themselves there   
    and absalom  and all the people the men of israel  came to jerusalem  and ahithophel with him   
   and it came to pass  when hushai the archite  david s friend  was come unto absalom  that hushai said unto absalom  god save the king  god save the king   
   and absalom said to hushai   is  this thy kindness to thy friend  why wentest thou not with thy friend   
   and hushai said unto absalom  nay  but whom the lord  and this people  and all the men of israel  choose  his will i be  and with him will i abide   
   and again  whom should i serve   should i  not  serve  in the presence of his son  as i have served in thy father s presence  so will i be in thy presence   
   then said absalom to ahithophel  give counsel among you what we shall do   
   and ahithophel said unto absalom  go in unto thy father s concubines  which he hath left to keep the house  and all israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father  then shall the hands of all that  are  with thee be strong   
   so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house  and absalom went in unto his father s concubines in the sight of all israel   
   and the counsel of ahithophel  which he counselled in those days   was  as if a man had enquired at the oracle of god  so  was  all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom   
  samuel    
   moreover ahithophel said unto absalom  let me now choose out twelve thousand men  and i will arise and pursue after david this night   
  and i will come upon him while he  is  weary and weak handed  and will make him afraid  and all the people that  are  with him shall flee  and i will smite the king only   
  and i will bring back all the people unto thee  the man whom thou seekest  is  as if all returned   so  all the people shall be in peace   
  and the saying pleased absalom well  and all the elders of israel   
  then said absalom  call now hushai the archite also  and let us hear likewise what he saith   
  and when hushai was come to absalom  absalom spake unto him  saying  ahithophel hath spoken after this manner  shall we do  after  his saying  if not  speak thou   
  and hushai said unto absalom  the counsel that ahithophel hath given  is  not good at this time   
  for  said hushai  thou knowest thy father and his men  that they  be  mighty men  and they  be  chafed in their minds  as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field  and thy father  is  a man of war  and will not lodge with the people   
  behold  he is hid now in some pit  or in some  other  place  and it will come to pass  when some of them be overthrown at the first  that whosoever heareth it will say  there is a slaughter among the people that follow absalom   
   and he also  that is  valiant  whose heart  is  as the heart of a lion  shall utterly melt  for all israel knoweth that thy father  is  a mighty man  and  they  which  be  with him  are  valiant men   
   therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gathered unto thee  from dan even to beersheba  as the sand that  is  by the sea for multitude  and that thou go to battle in thine own person   
   so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found  and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground  and of him and of all the men that  are  with him there shall not be left so much as one   
   moreover  if he be gotten into a city  then shall all israel bring ropes to that city  and we will draw it into the river  until there be not one small stone found there   
   and absalom and all the men of israel said  the counsel of hushai the archite  is  better than the counsel of ahithophel  for the lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel  to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom   
    then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests  thus and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel  and thus and thus have i counselled   
   now therefore send quickly  and tell david  saying  lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness  but speedily pass over  lest the king be swallowed up  and all the people that  are  with him   
   now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by enrogel  for they might not be seen to come into the city  and a wench went and told them  and they went and told king david   
   nevertheless a lad saw them  and told absalom  but they went both of them away quickly  and came to a man s house in bahurim  which had a well in his court  whither they went down   
   and the woman took and spread a covering over the well s mouth  and spread ground corn thereon  and the thing was not known   
   and when absalom s servants came to the woman to the house  they said  where  is  ahimaaz and jonathan  and the woman said unto them  they be gone over the brook of water  and when they had sought and could not find  them   they returned to jerusalem   
   and it came to pass  after they were departed  that they came up out of the well  and went and told king david  and said unto david  arise  and pass quickly over the water  for thus hath ahithophel counselled against you   
    then david arose  and all the people that  were  with him  and they passed over jordan  by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over jordan   
   and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed  he saddled  his  ass  and arose  and gat him home to his house  to his city  and put his household in order  and hanged himself  and died  and was buried in the sepulchre of his father   
   then david came to mahanaim  and absalom passed over jordan  he and all the men of israel with him   
   and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab  which amasa  was  a man s son  whose name  was  ithra an israelite  that went in to abigail the daughter of nahash  sister to zeruiah joab s mother   
   so israel and absalom pitched in the land of gilead   
   and it came to pass  when david was come to mahanaim  that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon  and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar  and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim   
   brought beds  and basons  and earthen vessels  and wheat  and barley  and flour  and parched  corn   and beans  and lentiles  and parched  pulse    
   and honey  and butter  and sheep  and cheese of kine  for david  and for the people that  were  with him  to eat  for they said  the people  is  hungry  and weary  and thirsty  in the wilderness   
  samuel    
   and david numbered the people that  were  with him  and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them   
  and david sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of joab  and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah  joab s brother  and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite  and the king said unto the people  i will surely go forth with you myself also   
  but the people answered  thou shalt not go forth  for if we flee away  they will not care for us  neither if half of us die  will they care for us  but now  thou art  worth ten thousand of us  therefore now  it is  better that thou succour us out of the city   
  and the king said unto them  what seemeth you best i will do  and the king stood by the gate side  and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands   
  and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai  saying   deal  gently for my sake with the young man   even  with absalom  and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning absalom   
  so the people went out into the field against israel  and the battle was in the wood of ephraim   
  where the people of israel were slain before the servants of david  and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand  men    
  for the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country  and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured   
   and absalom met the servants of david  and absalom rode upon a mule  and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak  and his head caught hold of the oak  and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth  and the mule that  was  under him went away   
   and a certain man saw  it   and told joab  and said  behold  i saw absalom hanged in an oak   
   and joab said unto the man that told him  and  behold  thou sawest  him   and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground  and i would have given thee ten  shekels  of silver  and a girdle   
   and the man said unto joab  though i should receive a thousand  shekels  of silver in mine hand   yet  would i not put forth mine hand against the king s son  for in our hearing the king charged thee and abishai and ittai  saying  beware that none  touch  the young man absalom   
   otherwise i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life  for there is no matter hid from the king  and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against  me    
   then said joab  i may not tarry thus with thee  and he took three darts in his hand  and thrust them through the heart of absalom  while he  was  yet alive in the midst of the oak   
   and ten young men that bare joab s armour compassed about and smote absalom  and slew him   
   and joab blew the trumpet  and the people returned from pursuing after israel  for joab held back the people   
   and they took absalom  and cast him into a great pit in the wood  and laid a very great heap of stones upon him  and all israel fled every one to his tent   
   now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar  which  is  in the king s dale  for he said  i have no son to keep my name in remembrance  and he called the pillar after his own name  and it is called unto this day  absalom s place   
    then said ahimaaz the son of zadok  let me now run  and bear the king tidings  how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies   
   and joab said unto him  thou shalt not bear tidings this day  but thou shalt bear tidings another day  but this day thou shalt bear no tidings  because the king s son is dead   
   then said joab to cushi  go tell the king what thou hast seen  and cushi bowed himself unto joab  and ran   
   then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab  but howsoever  let me  i pray thee  also run after cushi  and joab said  wherefore wilt thou run  my son  seeing that thou hast no tidings ready   
   but howsoever   said he   let me run  and he said unto him  run  then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain  and overran cushi   
   and david sat between the two gates  and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall  and lifted up his eyes  and looked  and behold a man running alone   
   and the watchman cried  and told the king  and the king said  if he  be  alone   there is  tidings in his mouth  and he came apace  and drew near   
   and the watchman saw another man running  and the watchman called unto the porter  and said  behold  another  man running alone  and the king said  he also bringeth tidings   
   and the watchman said  me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok  and the king said  he  is  a good man  and cometh with good tidings   
   and ahimaaz called  and said unto the king  all is well  and he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king  and said  blessed  be  the lord thy god  which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king   
   and the king said  is the young man absalom safe  and ahimaaz answered  when joab sent the king s servant  and  me  thy servant  i saw a great tumult  but i knew not what  it was    
   and the king said  unto him   turn aside   and  stand here  and he turned aside  and stood still   
   and  behold  cushi came  and cushi said  tidings  my lord the king  for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee   
   and the king said unto cushi  is the young man absalom safe  and cushi answered  the enemies of my lord the king  and all that rise against thee to do  thee  hurt  be as  that  young man  is    
   and the king was much moved  and went up to the chamber over the gate  and wept  and as he went  thus he said  o my son absalom  my son  my son absalom  would god i had died for thee  o absalom  my son  my son   
  samuel    
   and it was told joab  behold  the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom   
  and the victory that day was  turned  into mourning unto all the people  for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son   
  and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city  as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle   
  but the king covered his face  and the king cried with a loud voice  o my son absalom  o absalom  my son  my son   
  and joab came into the house to the king  and said  thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants  which this day have saved thy life  and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters  and the lives of thy wives  and the lives of thy concubines   
  in that thou lovest thine enemies  and hatest thy friends  for thou hast declared this day  that thou regardest neither princes nor servants  for this day i perceive  that if absalom had lived  and all we had died this day  then it had pleased thee well   
  now therefore arise  go forth  and speak comfortably unto thy servants  for i swear by the lord  if thou go not forth  there will not tarry one with thee this night  and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now   
  then the king arose  and sat in the gate  and they told unto all the people  saying  behold  the king doth sit in the gate  and all the people came before the king  for israel had fled every man to his tent   
   and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of israel  saying  the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies  and he delivered us out of the hand of the philistines  and now he is fled out of the land for absalom   
   and absalom  whom we anointed over us  is dead in battle  now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back   
   and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests  saying  speak unto the elders of judah  saying  why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house  seeing the speech of all israel is come to the king   even  to his house   
   ye  are  my brethren  ye  are  my bones and my flesh  wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king   
   and say ye to amasa   art  thou not of my bone  and of my flesh  god do so to me  and more also  if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of joab   
   and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah  even as  the heart of  one man  so that they sent  this word  unto the king  return thou  and all thy servants   
   so the king returned  and came to jordan  and judah came to gilgal  to go to meet the king  to conduct the king over jordan   
    and shimei the son of gera  a benjamite  which  was  of bahurim  hasted and came down with the men of judah to meet king david   
   and  there were  a thousand men of benjamin with him  and ziba the servant of the house of saul  and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him  and they went over jordan before the king   
   and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king s household  and to do what he thought good  and shimei the son of gera fell down before the king  as he was come over jordan   
   and said unto the king  let not my lord impute iniquity unto me  neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of jerusalem  that the king should take it to his heart   
   for thy servant doth know that i have sinned  therefore  behold  i am come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king   
   but abishai the son of zeruiah answered and said  shall not shimei be put to death for this  because he cursed the lord s anointed   
   and david said  what have i to do with you  ye sons of zeruiah  that ye should this day be adversaries unto me  shall there any man be put to death this day in israel  for do not i know that i  am  this day king over israel   
   therefore the king said unto shimei  thou shalt not die  and the king sware unto him   
    and mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king  and had neither dressed his feet  nor trimmed his beard  nor washed his clothes  from the day the king departed until the day he came  again  in peace   
   and it came to pass  when he was come to jerusalem to meet the king  that the king said unto him  wherefore wentest not thou with me  mephibosheth   
   and he answered  my lord  o king  my servant deceived me  for thy servant said  i will saddle me an ass  that i may ride thereon  and go to the king  because thy servant  is  lame   
   and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king  but my lord the king  is  as an angel of god  do therefore  what is  good in thine eyes   
   for all  of  my father s house were but dead men before my lord the king  yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table  what right therefore have i yet to cry any more unto the king   
   and the king said unto him  why speakest thou any more of thy matters  i have said  thou and ziba divide the land   
   and mephibosheth said unto the king  yea  let him take all  forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house   
    and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim  and went over jordan with the king  to conduct him over jordan   
   now barzillai was a very aged man   even  fourscore years old  and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim  for he  was  a very great man   
   and the king said unto barzillai  come thou over with me  and i will feed thee with me in jerusalem   
   and barzillai said unto the king  how long have i to live  that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem   
   i  am  this day fourscore years old   and  can i discern between good and evil  can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink  can i hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women  wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king   
   thy servant will go a little way over jordan with the king  and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward   
   let thy servant  i pray thee  turn back again  that i may die in mine own city   and be buried  by the grave of my father and of my mother  but behold thy servant chimham  let him go over with my lord the king  and do to him what shall seem good unto thee   
   and the king answered  chimham shall go over with me  and i will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee  and whatsoever thou shalt require of me   that  will i do for thee   
   and all the people went over jordan  and when the king was come over  the king kissed barzillai  and blessed him  and he returned unto his own place   
    then the king went on to gilgal  and chimham went on with him  and all the people of judah conducted the king  and also half the people of israel   
   and  behold  all the men of israel came to the king  and said unto the king  why have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee away  and have brought the king  and his household  and all david s men with him  over jordan   
   and all the men of judah answered the men of israel  because the king  is  near of kin to us  wherefore then be ye angry for this matter  have we eaten at all of the king s  cost   or hath he given us any gift   
   and the men of israel answered the men of judah  and said  we have ten parts in the king  and we have also more  right  in david than ye  why then did ye despise us  that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king  and the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the men of israel   
  samuel    
   and there happened to be there a man of belial  whose name  was  sheba  the son of bichri  a benjamite  and he blew a trumpet  and said  we have no part in david  neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse  every man to his tents  o israel   
  so every man of israel went up from after david   and  followed sheba the son of bichri  but the men of judah clave unto their king  from jordan even to jerusalem   
  and david came to his house at jerusalem  and the king took the ten women  his  concubines  whom he had left to keep the house  and put them in ward  and fed them  but went not in unto them  so they were shut up unto the day of their death  living in widowhood   
   then said the king to amasa  assemble me the men of judah within three days  and be thou here present   
  so amasa went to assemble  the men of  judah  but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him   
  and david said to abishai  now shall sheba the son of bichri do us more harm than  did  absalom  take thou thy lord s servants  and pursue after him  lest he get him fenced cities  and escape us   
  and there went out after him joab s men  and the cherethites  and the pelethites  and all the mighty men  and they went out of jerusalem  to pursue after sheba the son of bichri   
  when they  were  at the great stone which  is  in gibeon  amasa went before them  and joab s garment that he had put on was girded unto him  and upon it a girdle  with  a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof  and as he went forth it fell out   
  and joab said to amasa   art  thou in health  my brother  and joab took amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him   
   but amasa took no heed to the sword that  was  in joab s hand  so he smote him therewith in the fifth  rib   and shed out his bowels to the ground  and struck him not again  and he died  so joab and abishai his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri   
   and one of joab s men stood by him  and said  he that favoureth joab  and he that  is  for david   let him go  after joab   
   and amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway  and when the man saw that all the people stood still  he removed amasa out of the highway into the field  and cast a cloth upon him  when he saw that every one that came by him stood still   
   when he was removed out of the highway  all the people went on after joab  to pursue after sheba the son of bichri   
    and he went through all the tribes of israel unto abel  and to bethmaachah  and all the berites  and they were gathered together  and went also after him   
   and they came and besieged him in abel of bethmaachah  and they cast up a bank against the city  and it stood in the trench  and all the people that  were  with joab battered the wall  to throw it down   
   then cried a wise woman out of the city  hear  hear  say  i pray you  unto joab  come near hither  that i may speak with thee   
   and when he was come near unto her  the woman said   art  thou joab  and he answered  i  am he   then she said unto him  hear the words of thine handmaid  and he answered  i do hear   
   then she spake  saying  they were wont to speak in old time  saying  they shall surely ask  counsel  at abel  and so they ended  the matter    
   i  am one of them that are  peaceable  and  faithful in israel  thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel  why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the lord   
   and joab answered and said  far be it  far be it from me  that i should swallow up or destroy   
   the matter  is  not so  but a man of mount ephraim  sheba the son of bichri by name  hath lifted up his hand against the king   even  against david  deliver him only  and i will depart from the city  and the woman said unto joab  behold  his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall   
   then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom  and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri  and cast  it  out to joab  and he blew a trumpet  and they retired from the city  every man to his tent  and joab returned to jerusalem unto the king   
    now joab  was  over all the host of israel  and benaiah the son of jehoiada  was  over the cherethites and over the pelethites   
   and adoram  was  over the tribute  and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud  was  recorder   
   and sheva  was  scribe  and zadok and abiathar  were  the priests   
   and ira also the jairite was a chief ruler about david   
  samuel    
   then there was a famine in the days of david three years  year after year  and david enquired of the lord  and the lord answered   it is  for saul  and for  his  bloody house  because he slew the gibeonites   
  and the king called the gibeonites  and said unto them   now the gibeonites  were  not of the children of israel  but of the remnant of the amorites  and the children of israel had sworn unto them  and saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of israel and judah    
  wherefore david said unto the gibeonites  what shall i do for you  and wherewith shall i make the atonement  that ye may bless the inheritance of the lord   
  and the gibeonites said unto him  we will have no silver nor gold of saul  nor of his house  neither for us shalt thou kill any man in israel  and he said  what ye shall say   that  will i do for you   
  and they answered the king  the man that consumed us  and that devised against us  that  we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of israel   
  let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us  and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul   whom  the lord did choose  and the king said  i will give  them    
  but the king spared mephibosheth  the son of jonathan the son of saul  because of the lord s oath that  was  between them  between david and jonathan the son of saul   
  but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah  whom she bare unto saul  armoni and mephibosheth  and the five sons of michal the daughter of saul  whom she brought up for adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite   
  and he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites  and they hanged them in the hill before the lord  and they fell  all  seven together  and were put to death in the days of harvest  in the first  days   in the beginning of barley harvest   
    and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth  and spread it for her upon the rock  from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven  and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day  nor the beasts of the field by night   
   and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah  the concubine of saul  had done   
   and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead  which had stolen them from the street of bethshan  where the philistines had hanged them  when the philistines had slain saul in gilboa   
   and he brought up from thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son  and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged   
   and the bones of saul and jonathan his son buried they in the country of benjamin in zelah  in the sepulchre of kish his father  and they performed all that the king commanded  and after that god was intreated for the land   
    moreover the philistines had yet war again with israel  and david went down  and his servants with him  and fought against the philistines  and david waxed faint   
   and ishbibenob  which  was  of the sons of the giant  the weight of whose spear  weighed  three hundred  shekels  of brass in weight  he being girded with a new  sword   thought to have slain david   
   but abishai the son of zeruiah succoured him  and smote the philistine  and killed him  then the men of david sware unto him  saying  thou shalt go no more out with us to battle  that thou quench not the light of israel   
   and it came to pass after this  that there was again a battle with the philistines at gob  then sibbechai the hushathite slew saph  which  was  of the sons of the giant   
   and there was again a battle in gob with the philistines  where elhanan the son of jaareoregim  a bethlehemite  slew  the brother of  goliath the gittite  the staff of whose spear  was  like a weaver s beam   
   and there was yet a battle in gath  where was a man of  great  stature  that had on every hand six fingers  and on every foot six toes  four and twenty in number  and he also was born to the giant   
   and when he defied israel  jonathan the son of shimea the brother of david slew him   
   these four were born to the giant in gath  and fell by the hand of david  and by the hand of his servants   
  samuel    
   and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day  that  the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies  and out of the hand of saul   
   and he said  the lord  is  my rock  and my fortress  and my deliverer   
  the god of my rock  in him will i trust   he is  my shield  and the horn of my salvation  my high tower  and my refuge  my saviour  thou savest me from violence   
  i will call on the lord   who is  worthy to be praised  so shall i be saved from mine enemies   
  when the waves of death compassed me  the floods of ungodly men made me afraid   
  the sorrows of hell compassed me about  the snares of death prevented me   
  in my distress i called upon the lord  and cried to my god  and he did hear my voice out of his temple  and my cry  did enter  into his ears   
  then the earth shook and trembled  the foundations of heaven moved and shook  because he was wroth   
  there went up a smoke out of his nostrils  and fire out of his mouth devoured  coals were kindled by it   
   he bowed the heavens also  and came down  and darkness  was  under his feet   
   and he rode upon a cherub  and did fly  and he was seen upon the wings of the wind   
   and he made darkness pavilions round about him  dark waters   and  thick clouds of the skies   
   through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled   
   the lord thundered from heaven  and the most high uttered his voice   
   and he sent out arrows  and scattered them  lightning  and discomfited them   
   and the channels of the sea appeared  the foundations of the world were discovered  at the rebuking of the lord  at the blast of the breath of his nostrils   
   he sent from above  he took me  he drew me out of many waters   
   he delivered me from my strong enemy   and  from them that hated me  for they were too strong for me   
   they prevented me in the day of my calamity  but the lord was my stay   
   he brought me forth also into a large place  he delivered me  because he delighted in me   
   the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness  according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me   
   for i have kept the ways of the lord  and have not wickedly departed from my god   
   for all his judgments  were  before me  and  as for  his statutes  i did not depart from them   
   i was also upright before him  and have kept myself from mine iniquity   
   therefore the lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness  according to my cleanness in his eye sight   
   with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful   and  with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright   
   with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure  and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury   
   and the afflicted people thou wilt save  but thine eyes  are  upon the haughty   that  thou mayest bring  them  down   
   for thou  art  my lamp  o lord  and the lord will lighten my darkness   
   for by thee i have run through a troop  by my god have i leaped over a wall   
    as for  god  his way  is  perfect  the word of the lord  is  tried  he  is  a buckler to all them that trust in him   
   for who  is  god  save the lord  and who  is  a rock  save our god   
   god  is  my strength  and  power  and he maketh my way perfect   
   he maketh my feet like hinds   feet   and setteth me upon my high places   
   he teacheth my hands to war  so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms   
   thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation  and thy gentleness hath made me great   
   thou hast enlarged my steps under me  so that my feet did not slip   
   i have pursued mine enemies  and destroyed them  and turned not again until i had consumed them   
   and i have consumed them  and wounded them  that they could not arise  yea  they are fallen under my feet   
   for thou hast girded me with strength to battle  them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me   
   thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies  that i might destroy them that hate me   
   they looked  but  there was  none to save   even  unto the lord  but he answered them not   
   then did i beat them as small as the dust of the earth  i did stamp them as the mire of the street   and  did spread them abroad   
   thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people  thou hast kept me  to be  head of the heathen  a people  which  i knew not shall serve me   
   strangers shall submit themselves unto me  as soon as they hear  they shall be obedient unto me   
   strangers shall fade away  and they shall be afraid out of their close places   
   the lord liveth  and blessed  be  my rock  and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation   
   it  is  god that avengeth me  and that bringeth down the people under me   
   and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies  thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me  thou hast delivered me from the violent man   
   therefore i will give thanks unto thee  o lord  among the heathen  and i will sing praises unto thy name   
    he is  the tower of salvation for his king  and sheweth mercy to his anointed  unto david  and to his seed for evermore   
  samuel    
   now these  be  the last words of david  david the son of jesse said  and the man  who was  raised up on high  the anointed of the god of jacob  and the sweet psalmist of israel  said   
  the spirit of the lord spake by me  and his word  was  in my tongue   
  the god of israel said  the rock of israel spake to me  he that ruleth over men  must be  just  ruling in the fear of god   
  and  he shall be  as the light of the morning   when  the sun riseth   even  a morning without clouds   as  the tender grass  springing  out of the earth by clear shining after rain   
  although my house  be  not so with god  yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant  ordered in all  things   and sure  for  this is  all my salvation  and all  my  desire  although he make  it  not to grow   
  but  the sons  of belial  shall be  all of them as thorns thrust away  because they cannot be taken with hands   
  but the man  that  shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear  and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the  same  place   
   these  be  the names of the mighty men whom david had  the tachmonite that sat in the seat  chief among the captains  the same  was  adino the eznite   he lift up his spear  against eight hundred  whom he slew at one time   
  and after him  was  eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite   one  of the three mighty men with david  when they defied the philistines  that  were there gathered together to battle  and the men of israel were gone away   
   he arose  and smote the philistines until his hand was weary  and his hand clave unto the sword  and the lord wrought a great victory that day  and the people returned after him only to spoil   
   and after him  was  shammah the son of agee the hararite  and the philistines were gathered together into a troop  where was a piece of ground full of lentiles  and the people fled from the philistines   
   but he stood in the midst of the ground  and defended it  and slew the philistines  and the lord wrought a great victory   
   and three of the thirty chief went down  and came to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adullam  and the troop of the philistines pitched in the valley of rephaim   
   and david  was  then in an hold  and the garrison of the philistines  was  then  in  bethlehem   
   and david longed  and said  oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem  which  is  by the gate   
   and the three mighty men brake through the host of the philistines  and drew water out of the well of bethlehem  that  was  by the gate  and took  it   and brought  it  to david  nevertheless he would not drink thereof  but poured it out unto the lord   
   and he said  be it far from me  o lord  that i should do this   is not this  the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives  therefore he would not drink it  these things did these three mighty men   
   and abishai  the brother of joab  the son of zeruiah  was chief among three  and he lifted up his spear against three hundred   and  slew  them   and had the name among three   
   was he not most honourable of three  therefore he was their captain  howbeit he attained not unto the  first  three   
   and benaiah the son of jehoiada  the son of a valiant man  of kabzeel  who had done many acts  he slew two lionlike men of moab  he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow   
   and he slew an egyptian  a goodly man  and the egyptian had a spear in his hand  but he went down to him with a staff  and plucked the spear out of the egyptian s hand  and slew him with his own spear   
   these  things  did benaiah the son of jehoiada  and had the name among three mighty men   
   he was more honourable than the thirty  but he attained not to the  first  three  and david set him over his guard   
   asahel the brother of joab  was  one of the thirty  elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem   
   shammah the harodite  elika the harodite   
   helez the paltite  ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite   
   abiezer the anethothite  mebunnai the hushathite   
   zalmon the ahohite  maharai the netophathite   
   heleb the son of baanah  a netophathite  ittai the son of ribai out of gibeah of the children of benjamin   
   benaiah the pirathonite  hiddai of the brooks of gaash   
   abialbon the arbathite  azmaveth the barhumite   
   eliahba the shaalbonite  of the sons of jashen  jonathan   
   shammah the hararite  ahiam the son of sharar the hararite

   zelek the ammonite  naharai the beerothite  armourbearer to joab the son of zeruiah   
   ira an ithrite  gareb an ithrite   
   uriah the hittite  thirty and seven in all   
  samuel    
   and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel  and he moved david against them to say  go  number israel and judah   
  for the king said to joab the captain of the host  which  was  with him  go now through all the tribes of israel  from dan even to beersheba  and number ye the people  that i may know the number of the people   
  and joab said unto the king  now the lord thy god add unto the people  how many soever they be  an hundredfold  and that the eyes of my lord the king may see  it   but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing   
  notwithstanding the king s word prevailed against joab  and against the captains of the host  and joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king  to number the people of israel   
  and they passed over jordan  and pitched in aroer  on the right side of the city that  lieth  in the midst of the river of gad  and toward jazer   
  then they came to gilead  and to the land of tahtimhodshi  and they came to danjaan  and about to zidon   
  and came to the strong hold of tyre  and to all the cities of the hivites  and of the canaanites  and they went out to the south of judah   even  to beersheba   
  so when they had gone through all the land  they came to jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days   
  and joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king  and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword  and the men of judah  were  five hundred thousand men   
    and david s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people  and david said unto the lord  i have sinned greatly in that i have done  and now  i beseech thee  o lord  take away the iniquity of thy servant  for i have done very foolishly   
   for when david was up in the morning  the word of the lord came unto the prophet gad  david s seer  saying   
   go and say unto david  thus saith the lord  i offer thee three  things   choose thee one of them  that i may  do it  unto thee   
   so gad came to david  and told him  and said unto him  shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land  or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies  while they pursue thee  or that there be three days  pestilence in thy land  now advise  and see what answer i shall return to him that sent me   
   and david said unto gad  i am in a great strait  let us fall now into the hand of the lord  for his mercies  are  great  and let me not fall into the hand of man   
   so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appointed  and there died of the people from dan even to beersheba seventy thousand men   
   and when the angel stretched out his hand upon jerusalem to destroy it  the lord repented him of the evil  and said to the angel that destroyed the people  it is enough  stay now thine hand  and the angel of the lord was by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite   
   and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote the people  and said  lo  i have sinned  and i have done wickedly  but these sheep  what have they done  let thine hand  i pray thee  be against me  and against my father s house   
    and gad came that day to david  and said unto him  go up  rear an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite   
   and david  according to the saying of gad  went up as the lord commanded   
   and araunah looked  and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him  and araunah went out  and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground   
   and araunah said  wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant  and david said  to buy the threshingfloor of thee  to build an altar unto the lord  that the plague may be stayed from the people   
   and araunah said unto david  let my lord the king take and offer up what  seemeth  good unto him  behold   here be  oxen for burnt sacrifice  and threshing instruments and  other  instruments of the oxen for wood   
   all these  things  did araunah   as  a king  give unto the king  and araunah said unto the king  the lord thy god accept thee   
   and the king said unto araunah  nay  but i will surely buy  it  of thee at a price  neither will i offer burnt offerings unto the lord my god of that which doth cost me nothing  so david bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver   
   and david built there an altar unto the lord  and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings  so the lord was intreated for the land  and the plague was stayed from israel   
 
  kings 
  kings   
   now king david was old  and  stricken in years  and they covered him with clothes  but he gat no heat   
  wherefore his servants said unto him  let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin  and let her stand before the king  and let her cherish him  and let her lie in thy bosom  that my lord the king may get heat   
  so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of israel  and found abishag a shunammite  and brought her to the king   
  and the damsel  was  very fair  and cherished the king  and ministered to him  but the king knew her not   
   then adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself  saying  i will be king  and he prepared him chariots and horsemen  and fifty men to run before him   
  and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying  why hast thou done so  and he also  was a  very goodly  man   and  his mother  bare him after absalom   
  and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah  and with abiathar the priest  and they following adonijah helped  him    
  but zadok the priest  and benaiah the son of jehoiada  and nathan the prophet  and shimei  and rei  and the mighty men which  belonged  to david  were not with adonijah   
  and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of zoheleth  which  is  by enrogel  and called all his brethren the king s sons  and all the men of judah the king s servants   
   but nathan the prophet  and benaiah  and the mighty men  and solomon his brother  he called not   
    wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon  saying  hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign  and david our lord knoweth  it  not   
   now therefore come  let me  i pray thee  give thee counsel  that thou mayest save thine own life  and the life of thy son solomon   
   go and get thee in unto king david  and say unto him  didst not thou  my lord  o king  swear unto thine handmaid  saying  assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me  and he shall sit upon my throne  why then doth adonijah reign   
   behold  while thou yet talkest there with the king  i also will come in after thee  and confirm thy words   
   and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber  and the king was very old  and abishag the shunammite ministered unto the king   
   and bathsheba bowed  and did obeisance unto the king  and the king said  what wouldest thou   
   and she said unto him  my lord  thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid   saying   assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me  and he shall sit upon my throne   
   and now  behold  adonijah reigneth  and now  my lord the king  thou knowest  it  not   
   and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance  and hath called all the sons of the king  and abiathar the priest  and joab the captain of the host  but solomon thy servant hath he not called   
   and thou  my lord  o king  the eyes of all israel  are  upon thee  that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him   
   otherwise it shall come to pass  when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers  that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders   
   and  lo  while she yet talked with the king  nathan the prophet also came in   
   and they told the king  saying  behold nathan the prophet  and when he was come in before the king  he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground   
   and nathan said  my lord  o king  hast thou said  adonijah shall reign after me  and he shall sit upon my throne   
   for he is gone down this day  and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance  and hath called all the king s sons  and the captains of the host  and abiathar the priest  and  behold  they eat and drink before him  and say  god save king adonijah   
   but me   even  me thy servant  and zadok the priest  and benaiah the son of jehoiada  and thy servant solomon  hath he not called   
   is this thing done by my lord the king  and thou hast not shewed  it  unto thy servant  who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him   
   then king david answered and said  call me bathsheba  and she came into the king s presence  and stood before the king   
   and the king sware  and said   as  the lord liveth  that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress   
   even as i sware unto thee by the lord god of israel  saying  assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me  and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead  even so will i certainly do this day   
   then bathsheba bowed with  her  face to the earth  and did reverence to the king  and said  let my lord king david live for ever   
    and king david said  call me zadok the priest  and nathan the prophet  and benaiah the son of jehoiada  and they came before the king   
   the king also said unto them  take with you the servants of your lord  and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule  and bring him down to gihon   
   and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel  and blow ye with the trumpet  and say  god save king solomon   
   then ye shall come up after him  that he may come and sit upon my throne  for he shall be king in my stead  and i have appointed him to be ruler over israel and over judah   
   and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king  and said  amen  the lord god of my lord the king say so  too    
   as the lord hath been with my lord the king  even so be he with solomon  and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david   
   so zadok the priest  and nathan the prophet  and benaiah the son of jehoiada  and the cherethites  and the pelethites  went down  and caused solomon to ride upon king david s mule  and brought him to gihon   
   and zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle  and anointed solomon  and they blew the trumpet  and all the people said  god save king solomon   
   and all the people came up after him  and the people piped with pipes  and rejoiced with great joy  so that the earth rent with the sound of them   
    and adonijah and all the guests that  were  with him heard  it  as they had made an end of eating  and when joab heard the sound of the trumpet  he said  wherefore  is this  noise of the city being in an uproar   
   and while he yet spake  behold  jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came  and adonijah said unto him  come in  for thou  art  a valiant man  and bringest good tidings   
   and jonathan answered and said to adonijah  verily our lord king david hath made solomon king   
   and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest  and nathan the prophet  and benaiah the son of jehoiada  and the cherethites  and the pelethites  and they have caused him to ride upon the king s mule   
   and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king in gihon  and they are come up from thence rejoicing  so that the city rang again  this  is  the noise that ye have heard   
   and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom   
   and moreover the king s servants came to bless our lord king david  saying  god make the name of solomon better than thy name  and make his throne greater than thy throne  and the king bowed himself upon the bed   
   and also thus said the king  blessed  be  the lord god of israel  which hath given  one  to sit on my throne this day  mine eyes even seeing  it    
   and all the guests that  were  with adonijah were afraid  and rose up  and went every man his way   
   and adonijah feared because of solomon  and arose  and went  and caught hold on the horns of the altar   
   and it was told solomon  saying  behold  adonijah feareth king solomon  for  lo  he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar  saying  let king solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword   
   and solomon said  if he will shew himself a worthy man  there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth  but if wickedness shall be found in him  he shall die   
   so king solomon sent  and they brought him down from the altar  and he came and bowed himself to king solomon  and solomon said unto him  go to thine house   
  kings   
   now the days of david drew nigh that he should die  and he charged solomon his son  saying   
  i go the way of all the earth  be thou strong therefore  and shew thyself a man   
  and keep the charge of the lord thy god  to walk in his ways  to keep his statutes  and his commandments  and his judgments  and his testimonies  as it is written in the law of moses  that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest  and whithersoever thou turnest thyself   
  that the lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me  saying  if thy children take heed to their way  to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul  there shall not fail thee  said he  a man on the throne of israel   
  moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me   and  what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel  unto abner the son of ner  and unto amasa the son of jether  whom he slew  and shed the blood of war in peace  and put the blood of war upon his girdle that  was  about his loins  and in his shoes that  were  on his feet   
  do therefore according to thy wisdom  and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace   
  but shew kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite  and let them be of those that eat at thy table  for so they came to me when i fled because of absalom thy brother   
  and  behold   thou hast  with thee shimei the son of gera  a benjamite of bahurim  which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanaim  but he came down to meet me at jordan  and i sware to him by the lord  saying  i will not put thee to death with the sword   
  now therefore hold him not guiltless  for thou  art  a wise man  and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him  but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood   
   so david slept with his fathers  and was buried in the city of david   
   and the days that david reigned over israel  were  forty years  seven years reigned he in hebron  and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem   
    then sat solomon upon the throne of david his father  and his kingdom was established greatly   
   and adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of solomon  and she said  comest thou peaceably  and he said  peaceably   
   he said moreover  i have somewhat to say unto thee  and she said  say on   
   and he said  thou knowest that the kingdom was mine  and  that  all israel set their faces on me  that i should reign  howbeit the kingdom is turned about  and is become my brother s  for it was his from the lord   
   and now i ask one petition of thee  deny me not  and she said unto him  say on   
   and he said  speak  i pray thee  unto solomon the king   for he will not say thee nay   that he give me abishag the shunammite to wife   
   and bathsheba said  well  i will speak for thee unto the king   
   bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon  to speak unto him for adonijah  and the king rose up to meet her  and bowed himself unto her  and sat down on his throne  and caused a seat to be set for the king s mother  and she sat on his right hand   
   then she said  i desire one small petition of thee   i pray thee   say me not nay  and the king said unto her  ask on  my mother  for i will not say thee nay   
   and she said  let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy brother to wife   
   and king solomon answered and said unto his mother  and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah  ask for him the kingdom also  for he  is  mine elder brother  even for him  and for abiathar the priest  and for joab the son of zeruiah   
   then king solomon sware by the lord  saying  god do so to me  and more also  if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life   
   now therefore   as  the lord liveth  which hath established me  and set me on the throne of david my father  and who hath made me an house  as he promised  adonijah shall be put to death this day   
   and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada  and he fell upon him that he died   
    and unto abiathar the priest said the king  get thee to anathoth  unto thine own fields  for thou  art  worthy of death  but i will not at this time put thee to death  because thou barest the ark of the lord god before david my father  and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted   
   so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto the lord  that he might fulfil the word of the lord  which he spake concerning the house of eli in shiloh   
   then tidings came to joab  for joab had turned after adonijah  though he turned not after absalom  and joab fled unto the tabernacle of the lord  and caught hold on the horns of the altar   
   and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the lord  and  behold   he is  by the altar  then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada  saying  go  fall upon him   
   and benaiah came to the tabernacle of the lord  and said unto him  thus saith the king  come forth  and he said  nay  but i will die here  and benaiah brought the king word again  saying  thus said joab  and thus he answered me   
   and the king said unto him  do as he hath said  and fall upon him  and bury him  that thou mayest take away the innocent blood  which joab shed  from me  and from the house of my father   
   and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head  who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he  and slew them with the sword  my father david not knowing  thereof  to wit   abner the son of ner  captain of the host of israel  and amasa the son of jether  captain of the host of judah   
   their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab  and upon the head of his seed for ever  but upon david  and upon his seed  and upon his house  and upon his throne  shall there be peace for ever from the lord   
   so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up  and fell upon him  and slew him  and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness   
    and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host  and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar   
   and the king sent and called for shimei  and said unto him  build thee an house in jerusalem  and dwell there  and go not forth thence any whither   
   for it shall be   that  on the day thou goest out  and passest over the brook kidron  thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die  thy blood shall be upon thine own head   
   and shimei said unto the king  the saying  is  good  as my lord the king hath said  so will thy servant do  and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many days   
   and it came to pass at the end of three years  that two of the servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath  and they told shimei  saying  behold  thy servants  be  in gath   
   and shimei arose  and saddled his ass  and went to gath to achish to seek his servants  and shimei went  and brought his servants from gath   
   and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath  and was come again   
   and the king sent and called for shimei  and said unto him  did i not make thee to swear by the lord  and protested unto thee  saying  know for a certain  on the day thou goest out  and walkest abroad any whither  that thou shalt surely die  and thou saidst unto me  the word  that  i have heard  is  good   
   why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord  and the commandment that i have charged thee with   
   the king said moreover to shimei  thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to  that thou didst to david my father  therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head   
   and king solomon  shall be  blessed  and the throne of david shall be established before the lord for ever   
   so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada  which went out  and fell upon him  that he died  and the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon   
  kings   
   and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt  and took pharaoh s daughter  and brought her into the city of david  until he had made an end of building his own house  and the house of the lord  and the wall of jerusalem round about   
  only the people sacrificed in high places  because there was no house built unto the name of the lord  until those days   
  and solomon loved the lord  walking in the statutes of david his father  only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places   
  and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there  for that  was  the great high place  a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer upon that altar   
   in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night  and god said  ask what i shall give thee   
  and solomon said  thou hast shewed unto thy servant david my father great mercy  according as he walked before thee in truth  and in righteousness  and in uprightness of heart with thee  and thou hast kept for him this great kindness  that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne  as  it is  this day   
  and now  o lord my god  thou hast made thy servant king instead of david my father  and i  am but  a little child  i know not  how  to go out or come in   
  and thy servant  is  in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen  a great people  that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude   
  give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people  that i may discern between good and bad  for who is able to judge this thy so great a people   
   and the speech pleased the lord  that solomon had asked this thing   
   and god said unto him  because thou hast asked this thing  and hast not asked for thyself long life  neither hast asked riches for thyself  nor hast asked the life of thine enemies  but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment   
   behold  i have done according to thy words  lo  i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart  so that there was none like thee before thee  neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee   
   and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked  both riches  and honour  so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days   
   and if thou wilt walk in my ways  to keep my statutes and my commandments  as thy father david did walk  then i will lengthen thy days   
   and solomon awoke  and  behold   it was  a dream  and he came to jerusalem  and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord  and offered up burnt offerings  and offered peace offerings  and made a feast to all his servants   
    then came there two women   that were  harlots  unto the king  and stood before him   
   and the one woman said  o my lord  i and this woman dwell in one house  and i was delivered of a child with her in the house   
   and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered  that this woman was delivered also  and we  were  together   there was  no stranger with us in the house  save we two in the house   
   and this woman s child died in the night  because she overlaid it   
   and she arose at midnight  and took my son from beside me  while thine handmaid slept  and laid it in her bosom  and laid her dead child in my bosom   
   and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck  behold  it was dead  but when i had considered it in the morning  behold  it was not my son  which i did bear   
   and the other woman said  nay  but the living  is  my son  and the dead  is  thy son  and this said  no  but the dead  is  thy son  and the living  is  my son  thus they spake before the king   
   then said the king  the one saith  this  is  my son that liveth  and thy son  is  the dead  and the other saith  nay  but thy son  is  the dead  and my son  is  the living   
   and the king said  bring me a sword  and they brought a sword before the king   
   and the king said  divide the living child in two  and give half to the one  and half to the other   
   then spake the woman whose the living child  was  unto the king  for her bowels yearned upon her son  and she said  o my lord  give her the living child  and in no wise slay it  but the other said  let it be neither mine nor thine   but  divide  it    
   then the king answered and said  give her the living child  and in no wise slay it  she  is  the mother thereof   
   and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged  and they feared the king  for they saw that the wisdom of god  was  in him  to do judgment   
  kings   
   so king solomon was king over all israel   
  and these  were  the princes which he had  azariah the son of zadok the priest   
  elihoreph and ahiah  the sons of shisha  scribes  jehoshaphat the son of ahilud  the recorder   
  and benaiah the son of jehoiada  was  over the host  and zadok and abiathar  were  the priests   
  and azariah the son of nathan  was  over the officers  and zabud the son of nathan  was  principal officer   and  the king s friend   
  and ahishar  was  over the household  and adoniram the son of abda  was  over the tribute   
  and solomon had twelve officers over all israel  which provided victuals for the king and his household  each man his month in a year made provision   
  and these  are  their names  the son of hur  in mount ephraim   
  the son of dekar  in makaz  and in shaalbim  and bethshemesh  and elonbethhanan   
   the son of hesed  in aruboth  to him  pertained  sochoh  and all the land of hepher   
   the son of abinadab  in all the region of dor  which had taphath the daughter of solomon to wife   
   baana the son of ahilud   to him pertained  taanach and megiddo  and all bethshean  which  is  by zartanah beneath jezreel  from bethshean to abelmeholah   even  unto  the place that is  beyond jokneam   
   the son of geber  in ramothgilead  to him  pertained  the towns of jair the son of manasseh  which  are  in gilead  to him  also pertained  the region of argob  which  is  in bashan  threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars   
   ahinadab the son of iddo  had  mahanaim   
   ahimaaz  was  in naphtali  he also took basmath the daughter of solomon to wife   
   baanah the son of hushai  was  in asher and in aloth   
   jehoshaphat the son of paruah  in issachar   
   shimei the son of elah  in benjamin   
   geber the son of uri  was  in the country of gilead   in  the country of sihon king of the amorites  and of og king of bashan  and  he was  the only officer which  was  in the land   
    judah and israel  were  many  as the sand which  is  by the sea in multitude  eating and drinking  and making merry   
   and solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the philistines  and unto the border of egypt  they brought presents  and served solomon all the days of his life   
   and solomon s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour  and threescore measures of meal   
   ten fat oxen  and twenty oxen out of the pastures  and an hundred sheep  beside harts  and roebucks  and fallowdeer  and fatted fowl   
   for he had dominion over all  the region  on this side the river  from tiphsah even to azzah  over all the kings on this side the river  and he had peace on all sides round about him   
   and judah and israel dwelt safely  every man under his vine and under his fig tree  from dan even to beersheba  all the days of solomon   
   and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots  and twelve thousand horsemen   
   and those officers provided victual for king solomon  and for all that came unto king solomon s table  every man in his month  they lacked nothing   
   barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where  the officers  were  every man according to his charge   
    and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much  and largeness of heart  even as the sand that  is  on the sea shore   
   and solomon s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country  and all the wisdom of egypt   
   for he was wiser than all men  than ethan the ezrahite  and heman  and chalcol  and darda  the sons of mahol  and his fame was in all nations round about   
   and he spake three thousand proverbs  and his songs were a thousand and five   
   and he spake of trees  from the cedar tree that  is  in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall  he spake also of beasts  and of fowl  and of creeping things  and of fishes   
   and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon  from all kings of the earth  which had heard of his wisdom   
  kings   
   and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon  for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father  for hiram was ever a lover of david   
  and solomon sent to hiram  saying   
  thou knowest how that david my father could not build an house unto the name of the lord his god for the wars which were about him on every side  until the lord put them under the soles of his feet   
  but now the lord my god hath given me rest on every side   so that there is  neither adversary nor evil occurrent   
  and  behold  i purpose to build an house unto the name of the lord my god  as the lord spake unto david my father  saying  thy son  whom i will set upon thy throne in thy room  he shall build an house unto my name   
  now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of lebanon  and my servants shall be with thy servants  and unto thee will i give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint  for thou knowest that  there is  not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the sidonians   
  and it came to pass  when hiram heard the words of solomon  that he rejoiced greatly  and said  blessed  be  the lord this day  which hath given unto david a wise son over this great people   
  and hiram sent to solomon  saying  i have considered the things which thou sentest to me for   and  i will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar  and concerning timber of fir   
  my servants shall bring  them  down from lebanon unto the sea  and i will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me  and will cause them to be discharged there  and thou shalt receive  them   and thou shalt accomplish my desire  in giving food for my household   
    so hiram gave solomon cedar trees and fir trees  according to  all his desire   
   and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat  for  food to his household  and twenty measures of pure oil  thus gave solomon to hiram year by year   
   and the lord gave solomon wisdom  as he promised him  and there was peace between hiram and solomon  and they two made a league together   
   and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel  and the levy was thirty thousand men   
   and he sent them to lebanon  ten thousand a month by courses  a month they were in lebanon   and  two months at home  and adoniram  was  over the levy   
   and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens  and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains   
   beside the chief of solomon s officers which  were  over the work  three thousand and three hundred  which ruled over the people that wrought in the work   
   and the king commanded  and they brought great stones  costly stones   and  hewed stones  to lay the foundation of the house   
   and solomon s builders and hiram s builders did hew  them   and the stonesquarers  so they prepared timber and stones to build the house   
  kings   
   and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt  in the fourth year of solomon s reign over israel  in the month zif  which  is  the second month  that he began to build the house of the lord   
  and the house which king solomon built for the lord  the length thereof  was  threescore cubits  and the breadth thereof twenty  cubits   and the height thereof thirty cubits   
  and the porch before the temple of the house  twenty cubits  was  the length thereof  according to the breadth of the house   and  ten cubits  was  the breadth thereof before the house   
  and for the house he made windows of narrow lights   
  and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about   against  the walls of the house round about   both  of the temple and of the oracle  and he made chambers round about   
  the nethermost chamber  was  five cubits broad  and the middle  was  six cubits broad  and the third  was  seven cubits broad  for without  in the wall  of the house he made narrowed rests round about  that  the beams  should not be fastened in the walls of the house   
  and the house  when it was in building  was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither  so that there was neither hammer nor axe  nor  any tool of iron heard in the house  while it was in building   
  the door for the middle chamber  was  in the right side of the house  and they went up with winding stairs into the middle  chamber   and out of the middle into the third   
  so he built the house  and finished it  and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar   
   and  then  he built chambers against all the house  five cubits high  and they rested on the house  with  timber of cedar   
    and the word of the lord came to solomon  saying   
    concerning  this house which thou art in building  if thou wilt walk in my statutes  and execute my judgments  and keep all my commandments to walk in them  then will i perform my word with thee  which i spake unto david thy father   
   and i will dwell among the children of israel  and will not forsake my people israel   
   so solomon built the house  and finished it   
    and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar  both the floor of the house  and the walls of the cieling   and  he covered  them  on the inside with wood  and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir   
   and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house  both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar  he even built  them  for it within   even  for the oracle   even  for the most holy  place    
   and the house  that  is   the temple before it  was forty cubits  long    
   and the cedar of the house within  was  carved with knops and open flowers  all  was  cedar  there was no stone seen   
   and the oracle he prepared in the house within  to set there the ark of the covenant of the lord   
   and the oracle in the forepart  was  twenty cubits in length  and twenty cubits in breadth  and twenty cubits in the height thereof  and he overlaid it with pure gold  and  so  covered the altar  which was of  cedar   
   so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold  and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle  and he overlaid it with gold   
   and the whole house he overlaid with gold  until he had finished all the house  also the whole altar that  was  by the oracle he overlaid with gold   
   and within the oracle he made two cherubims  of  olive tree   each  ten cubits high   
   and five cubits  was  the one wing of the cherub  and five cubits the other wing of the cherub  from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other  were  ten cubits   
   and the other cherub  was  ten cubits  both the cherubims  were  of one measure and one size   
   the height of the one cherub  was  ten cubits  and so  was it  of the other cherub   
   and he set the cherubims within the inner house  and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims  so that the wing of the one touched the  one  wall  and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall  and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house   
   and he overlaid the cherubims with gold   
   and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers  within and without   
   and the floor of the house he overlaid with gold  within and without   
   and for the entering of the oracle he made doors  of  olive tree  the lintel  and  side posts  were  a fifth part  of the wall    
   the two doors also  were of  olive tree  and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers  and overlaid  them  with gold  and spread gold upon the cherubims  and upon the palm trees   
   so also made he for the door of the temple posts  of  olive tree  a fourth part  of the wall    
   and the two doors  were of  fir tree  the two leaves of the one door  were  folding  and the two leaves of the other door  were  folding   
   and he carved  thereon  cherubims and palm trees and open flowers  and covered  them  with gold fitted upon the carved work   
   and he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone  and a row of cedar beams   
   in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the lord laid  in the month zif   
   and in the eleventh year  in the month bul  which  is  the eighth month  was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof  and according to all the fashion of it  so was he seven years in building it   
  kings   
   but solomon was building his own house thirteen years  and he finished all his house   
  he built also the house of the forest of lebanon  the length thereof  was  an hundred cubits  and the breadth thereof fifty cubits  and the height thereof thirty cubits  upon four rows of cedar pillars  with cedar beams upon the pillars   
  and  it was  covered with cedar above upon the beams  that  lay  on forty five pillars  fifteen  in  a row   
  and  there were  windows  in  three rows  and light  was  against light  in  three ranks   
  and all the doors and posts  were  square  with the windows  and light  was  against light  in  three ranks   
  and he made a porch of pillars  the length thereof  was  fifty cubits  and the breadth thereof thirty cubits  and the porch  was  before them  and the  other  pillars and the thick beam  were  before them   
  then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge   even  the porch of judgment  and  it was  covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other   
  and his house where he dwelt  had  another court within the porch   which  was of the like work  solomon made also an house for pharaoh s daughter  whom he had taken  to wife   like unto this porch   
  all these  were of  costly stones  according to the measures of hewed stones  sawed with saws  within and without  even from the foundation unto the coping  and  so  on the outside toward the great court   
   and the foundation  was of  costly stones  even great stones  stones of ten cubits  and stones of eight cubits   
   and above  were  costly stones  after the measures of hewed stones  and cedars   
   and the great court round about  was  with three rows of hewed stones  and a row of cedar beams  both for the inner court of the house of the lord  and for the porch of the house   
    and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre   
   he  was  a widow s son of the tribe of naphtali  and his father  was  a man of tyre  a worker in brass  and he was filled with wisdom  and understanding  and cunning to work all works in brass  and he came to king solomon  and wrought all his work   
   for he cast two pillars of brass  of eighteen cubits high apiece  and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about   
   and he made two chapiters  of  molten brass  to set upon the tops of the pillars  the height of the one chapiter  was  five cubits  and the height of the other chapiter  was  five cubits   
    and  nets of checker work  and wreaths of chain work  for the chapiters which  were  upon the top of the pillars  seven for the one chapiter  and seven for the other chapiter   
   and he made the pillars  and two rows round about upon the one network  to cover the chapiters that  were  upon the top  with pomegranates  and so did he for the other chapiter   
   and the chapiters that  were  upon the top of the pillars  were  of lily work in the porch  four cubits   
   and the chapiters upon the two pillars  had pomegranates  also above  over against the belly which  was  by the network  and the pomegranates  were  two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter   
   and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple  and he set up the right pillar  and called the name thereof jachin  and he set up the left pillar  and called the name thereof boaz   
   and upon the top of the pillars  was  lily work  so was the work of the pillars finished   
   and he made a molten sea  ten cubits from the one brim to the other   it was  round all about  and his height  was  five cubits  and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about   
   and under the brim of it round about  there were  knops compassing it  ten in a cubit  compassing the sea round about  the knops  were  cast in two rows  when it was cast   
   it stood upon twelve oxen  three looking toward the north  and three looking toward the west  and three looking toward the south  and three looking toward the east  and the sea  was set  above upon them  and all their hinder parts  were  inward   
   and it  was  an hand breadth thick  and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup  with flowers of lilies  it contained two thousand baths   
   and he made ten bases of brass  four cubits  was  the length of one base  and four cubits the breadth thereof  and three cubits the height of it   
   and the work of the bases  was  on this  manner   they had borders  and the borders  were  between the ledges   
   and on the borders that  were  between the ledges  were  lions  oxen  and cherubims  and upon the ledges  there was  a base above  and beneath the lions and oxen  were  certain additions made of thin work   
   and every base had four brasen wheels  and plates of brass  and the four corners thereof had undersetters  under the laver  were  undersetters molten  at the side of every addition   
   and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above  was  a cubit  but the mouth thereof  was  round  after  the work of the base  a cubit and an half  and also upon the mouth of it  were  gravings with their borders  foursquare  not round   
   and under the borders  were  four wheels  and the axletrees of the wheels  were joined  to the base  and the height of a wheel  was  a cubit and half a cubit   
   and the work of the wheels  was  like the work of a chariot wheel  their axletrees  and their naves  and their felloes  and their spokes   were  all molten   
   and  there were  four undersetters to the four corners of one base   and  the undersetters  were  of the very base itself   
   and in the top of the base  was there  a round compass of half a cubit high  and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof  were  of the same   
   for on the plates of the ledges thereof  and on the borders thereof  he graved cherubims  lions  and palm trees  according to the proportion of every one  and additions round about   
   after this  manner  he made the ten bases  all of them had one casting  one measure   and  one size   
   then made he ten lavers of brass  one laver contained forty baths   and  every laver was four cubits   and  upon every one of the ten bases one laver   
   and he put five bases on the right side of the house  and five on the left side of the house  and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south   
   and hiram made the lavers  and the shovels  and the basons  so hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king solomon for the house of the lord   
   the two pillars  and the  two  bowls of the chapiters that  were  on the top of the two pillars  and the two networks  to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which  were  upon the top of the pillars   
   and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks   even  two rows of pomegranates for one network  to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that  were  upon the pillars   
   and the ten bases  and ten lavers on the bases   
   and one sea  and twelve oxen under the sea   
   and the pots  and the shovels  and the basons  and all these vessels  which hiram made to king solomon for the house of the lord   were of  bright brass   
   in the plain of jordan did the king cast them  in the clay ground between succoth and zarthan   
   and solomon left all the vessels  unweighed   because they were exceeding many  neither was the weight of the brass found out   
    and solomon made all the vessels that  pertained  unto the house of the lord  the altar of gold  and the table of gold  whereupon the shewbread  was    
   and the candlesticks of pure gold  five on the right  side   and five on the left  before the oracle  with the flowers  and the lamps  and the tongs  of  gold   
   and the bowls  and the snuffers  and the basons  and the spoons  and the censers  of  pure gold  and the hinges  of  gold   both  for the doors of the inner house  the most holy  place  and  for the doors of the house   to wit   of the temple   
   so was ended all the work that king solomon made for the house of the lord  and solomon brought in the things which david his father had dedicated   even  the silver  and the gold  and the vessels  did he put among the treasures of the house of the lord   
  kings   
   then solomon assembled the elders of israel  and all the heads of the tribes  the chief of the fathers of the children of israel  unto king solomon in jerusalem  that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david  which  is  zion   
  and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim  which  is  the seventh month   
  and all the elders of israel came  and the priests took up the ark   
  and they brought up the ark of the lord  and the tabernacle of the congregation  and all the holy vessels that  were  in the tabernacle  even those did the priests and the levites bring up   
  and king solomon  and all the congregation of israel  that were assembled unto him   were  with him before the ark  sacrificing sheep and oxen  that could not be told nor numbered for multitude   
  and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place  into the oracle of the house  to the most holy  place  even  under the wings of the cherubims   
  for the cherubims spread forth  their  two wings over the place of the ark  and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above   
  and they drew out the staves  that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy  place  before the oracle  and they were not seen without  and there they are unto this day   
   there was  nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone  which moses put there at horeb  when the lord made  a covenant  with the children of israel  when they came out of the land of egypt   
   and it came to pass  when the priests were come out of the holy  place   that the cloud filled the house of the lord   
   so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud  for the glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord   
    then spake solomon  the lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness   
   i have surely built thee an house to dwell in  a settled place for thee to abide in for ever   
   and the king turned his face about  and blessed all the congregation of israel   and all the congregation of israel stood    
   and he said  blessed  be  the lord god of israel  which spake with his mouth unto david my father  and hath with his hand fulfilled  it   saying   
   since the day that i brought forth my people israel out of egypt  i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build an house  that my name might be therein  but i chose david to be over my people israel   
   and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel   
   and the lord said unto david my father  whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name  thou didst well that it was in thine heart   
   nevertheless thou shalt not build the house  but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins  he shall build the house unto my name   
   and the lord hath performed his word that he spake  and i am risen up in the room of david my father  and sit on the throne of israel  as the lord promised  and have built an house for the name of the lord god of israel   
   and i have set there a place for the ark  wherein  is  the covenant of the lord  which he made with our fathers  when he brought them out of the land of egypt   
    and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel  and spread forth his hands toward heaven   
   and he said  lord god of israel   there is  no god like thee  in heaven above  or on earth beneath  who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart   
   who hast kept with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him  thou spakest also with thy mouth  and hast fulfilled  it  with thine hand  as  it is  this day   
   therefore now  lord god of israel  keep with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him  saying  there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel  so that thy children take heed to their way  that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me   
   and now  o god of israel  let thy word  i pray thee  be verified  which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father   
   but will god indeed dwell on the earth  behold  the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee  how much less this house that i have builded   
   yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant  and to his supplication  o lord my god  to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer  which thy servant prayeth before thee to day   
   that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day   even  toward the place of which thou hast said  my name shall be there  that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place   
   and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant  and of thy people israel  when they shall pray toward this place  and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place  and when thou hearest  forgive   
   if any man trespass against his neighbour  and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear  and the oath come before thine altar in this house   
   then hear thou in heaven  and do  and judge thy servants  condemning the wicked  to bring his way upon his head  and justifying the righteous  to give him according to his righteousness   
   when thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy  because they have sinned against thee  and shall turn again to thee  and confess thy name  and pray  and make supplication unto thee in this house   
   then hear thou in heaven  and forgive the sin of thy people israel  and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers   
   when heaven is shut up  and there is no rain  because they have sinned against thee  if they pray toward this place  and confess thy name  and turn from their sin  when thou afflictest them   
   then hear thou in heaven  and forgive the sin of thy servants  and of thy people israel  that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk  and give rain upon thy land  which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance   
   if there be in the land famine  if there be pestilence  blasting  mildew  locust   or  if there be caterpiller  if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities  whatsoever plague  whatsoever sickness  there be    
   what prayer and supplication soever be  made  by any man   or  by all thy people israel  which shall know every man the plague of his own heart  and spread forth his hands toward this house   
   then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place  and forgive  and do  and give to every man according to his ways  whose heart thou knowest   for thou   even  thou only  knowest the hearts of all the children of men    
   that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers   
   moreover concerning a stranger  that  is  not of thy people israel  but cometh out of a far country for thy name s sake   
    for they shall hear of thy great name  and of thy strong hand  and of thy stretched out arm   when he shall come and pray toward this house   
   hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place  and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for  that all people of the earth may know thy name  to fear thee  as  do  thy people israel  and that they may know that this house  which i have builded  is called by thy name   
   if thy people go out to battle against their enemy  whithersoever thou shalt send them  and shall pray unto the lord toward the city which thou hast chosen  and  toward  the house that i have built for thy name   
   then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication  and maintain their cause   
   if they sin against thee   for  there is  no man that sinneth not   and thou be angry with them  and deliver them to the enemy  so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy  far or near   
    yet  if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives  and repent  and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives  saying  we have sinned  and have done perversely  we have committed wickedness   
   and  so  return unto thee with all their heart  and with all their soul  in the land of their enemies  which led them away captive  and pray unto thee toward their land  which thou gavest unto their fathers  the city which thou hast chosen  and the house which i have built for thy name   
   then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place  and maintain their cause   
   and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee  and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee  and give them compassion before them who carried them captive  that they may have compassion on them   
   for they  be  thy people  and thine inheritance  which thou broughtest forth out of egypt  from the midst of the furnace of iron   
   that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant  and unto the supplication of thy people israel  to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee   
   for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth   to be  thine inheritance  as thou spakest by the hand of moses thy servant  when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt  o lord god   
    and it was  so   that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the lord  he arose from before the altar of the lord  from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven   
   and he stood  and blessed all the congregation of israel with a loud voice  saying   
   blessed  be  the lord  that hath given rest unto his people israel  according to all that he promised  there hath not failed one word of all his good promise  which he promised by the hand of moses his servant   
   the lord our god be with us  as he was with our fathers  let him not leave us  nor forsake us   
   that he may incline our hearts unto him  to walk in all his ways  and to keep his commandments  and his statutes  and his judgments  which he commanded our fathers   
   and let these my words  wherewith i have made supplication before the lord  be nigh unto the lord our god day and night  that he maintain the cause of his servant  and the cause of his people israel at all times  as the matter shall require   
   that all the people of the earth may know that the lord  is  god   and that there is  none else   
   let your heart therefore be perfect with the lord our god  to walk in his statutes  and to keep his commandments  as at this day   
    and the king  and all israel with him  offered sacrifice before the lord   
   and solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings  which he offered unto the lord  two and twenty thousand oxen  and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep  so the king and all the children of israel dedicated the house of the lord   
   the same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that  was  before the house of the lord  for there he offered burnt offerings  and meat offerings  and the fat of the peace offerings  because the brasen altar that  was  before the lord  was  too little to receive the burnt offerings  and meat offerings  and the fat of the peace offerings   
   and at that time solomon held a feast  and all israel with him  a great congregation  from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt  before the lord our god  seven days and seven days   even  fourteen days   
   on the eighth day he sent the people away  and they blessed the king  and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the lord had done for david his servant  and for israel his people   
  kings   
   and it came to pass  when solomon had finished the building of the house of the lord  and the king s house  and all solomon s desire which he was pleased to do   
  that the lord appeared to solomon the second time  as he had appeared unto him at gibeon   
  and the lord said unto him  i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication  that thou hast made before me  i have hallowed this house  which thou hast built  to put my name there for ever  and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually   
  and if thou wilt walk before me  as david thy father walked  in integrity of heart  and in uprightness  to do according to all that i have commanded thee   and  wilt keep my statutes and my judgments   
  then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever  as i promised to david thy father  saying  there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel   
   but  if ye shall at all turn from following me  ye or your children  and will not keep my commandments  and  my statutes which i have set before you  but go and serve other gods  and worship them   
  then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them  and this house  which i have hallowed for my name  will i cast out of my sight  and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people   
  and at this house   which  is high  every one that passeth by it shall be astonished  and shall hiss  and they shall say  why hath the lord done thus unto this land  and to this house   
  and they shall answer  because they forsook the lord their god  who brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt  and have taken hold upon other gods  and have worshipped them  and served them  therefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil   
    and it came to pass at the end of twenty years  when solomon had built the two houses  the house of the lord  and the king s house   
     now  hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedar trees and fir trees  and with gold  according to all his desire   that then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee   
   and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him  and they pleased him not   
   and he said  what cities  are  these which thou hast given me  my brother  and he called them the land of cabul unto this day   
   and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold   
    and this  is  the reason of the levy which king solomon raised  for to build the house of the lord  and his own house  and millo  and the wall of jerusalem  and hazor  and megiddo  and gezer   
    for  pharaoh king of egypt had gone up  and taken gezer  and burnt it with fire  and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city  and given it  for  a present unto his daughter  solomon s wife   
   and solomon built gezer  and bethhoron the nether   
   and baalath  and tadmor in the wilderness  in the land   
   and all the cities of store that solomon had  and cities for his chariots  and cities for his horsemen  and that which solomon desired to build in jerusalem  and in lebanon  and in all the land of his dominion   
    and  all the people  that were  left of the amorites  hittites  perizzites  hivites  and jebusites  which  were  not of the children of israel   
   their children that were left after them in the land  whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy  upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day   
   but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen  but they  were  men of war  and his servants  and his princes  and his captains  and rulers of his chariots  and his horsemen   
   these  were  the chief of the officers that  were  over solomon s work  five hundred and fifty  which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work   
   but pharaoh s daughter came up out of the city of david unto her house which  solomon  had built for her  then did he build millo   
   and three times in a year did solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the lord  and he burnt incense upon the altar that  was  before the lord  so he finished the house   
   and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber  which  is  beside eloth  on the shore of the red sea  in the land of edom   
   and hiram sent in the navy his servants  shipmen that had knowledge of the sea  with the servants of solomon   
   and they came to ophir  and fetched from thence gold  four hundred and twenty talents  and brought  it  to king solomon   
  kings    
   and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of the lord  she came to prove him with hard questions   
  and she came to jerusalem with a very great train  with camels that bare spices  and very much gold  and precious stones  and when she was come to solomon  she communed with him of all that was in her heart   
  and solomon told her all her questions  there was not  any  thing hid from the king  which he told her not   
  and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomon s wisdom  and the house that he had built   
  and the meat of his table  and the sitting of his servants  and the attendance of his ministers  and their apparel  and his cupbearers  and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the lord  there was no more spirit in her   
  and she said to the king  it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom   
  howbeit i believed not the words  until i came  and mine eyes had seen  it   and  behold  the half was not told me  thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard   
  happy  are  thy men  happy  are  these thy servants  which stand continually before thee   and  that hear thy wisdom   
  blessed be the lord thy god  which delighted in thee  to set thee on the throne of israel  because the lord loved israel for ever  therefore made he thee king  to do judgment and justice   
   and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold  and of spices very great store  and precious stones  there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon   
   and the navy also of hiram  that brought gold from ophir  brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees  and precious stones   
   and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the lord  and for the king s house  harps also and psalteries for singers  there came no such almug trees  nor were seen unto this day   
   and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desire  whatsoever she asked  beside  that  which solomon gave her of his royal bounty  so she turned and went to her own country  she and her servants   
    now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold   
   beside  that he had  of the merchantmen  and of the traffick of the spice merchants  and of all the kings of arabia  and of the governors of the country   
   and king solomon made two hundred targets  of  beaten gold  six hundred  shekels  of gold went to one target   
   and  he made  three hundred shields  of  beaten gold  three pound of gold went to one shield  and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon   
   moreover the king made a great throne of ivory  and overlaid it with the best gold   
   the throne had six steps  and the top of the throne  was  round behind  and  there were  stays on either side on the place of the seat  and two lions stood beside the stays   
   and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps  there was not the like made in any kingdom   
   and all king solomon s drinking vessels  were of  gold  and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon  were of  pure gold  none  were of  silver  it was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon   
   for the king had at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of hiram  once in three years came the navy of tharshish  bringing gold  and silver  ivory  and apes  and peacocks   
   so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom   
   and all the earth sought to solomon  to hear his wisdom  which god had put in his heart   
   and they brought every man his present  vessels of silver  and vessels of gold  and garments  and armour  and spices  horses  and mules  a rate year by year   
   and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen  and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots  and twelve thousand horsemen  whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots  and with the king at jerusalem   
   and the king made silver  to be  in jerusalem as stones  and cedars made he  to be  as the sycomore trees that  are  in the vale  for abundance   
   and solomon had horses brought out of egypt  and linen yarn  the king s merchants received the linen yarn at a price   
   and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred  shekels  of silver  and an horse for an hundred and fifty  and so for all the kings of the hittites  and for the kings of syria  did they bring  them  out by their means   
  kings    
   but king solomon loved many strange women  together with the daughter of pharaoh  women of the moabites  ammonites  edomites  zidonians   and  hittites   
  of the nations  concerning  which the lord said unto the children of israel  ye shall not go in to them  neither shall they come in unto you   for  surely they will turn away your heart after their gods  solomon clave unto these in love   
  and he had seven hundred wives  princesses  and three hundred concubines  and his wives turned away his heart   
  for it came to pass  when solomon was old   that  his wives turned away his heart after other gods  and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god  as  was  the heart of david his father   
  for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians  and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites   
  and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord  and went not fully after the lord  as  did  david his father   
  then did solomon build an high place for chemosh  the abomination of moab  in the hill that  is  before jerusalem  and for molech  the abomination of the children of ammon   
  and likewise did he for all his strange wives  which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods   
   and the lord was angry with solomon  because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel  which had appeared unto him twice   
   and had commanded him concerning this thing  that he should not go after other gods  but he kept not that which the lord commanded   
   wherefore the lord said unto solomon  forasmuch as this is done of thee  and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes  which i have commanded thee  i will surely rend the kingdom from thee  and will give it to thy servant   
   notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thy father s sake   but  i will rend it out of the hand of thy son   
   howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom   but  will give one tribe to thy son for david my servant s sake  and for jerusalem s sake which i have chosen   
    and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon  hadad the edomite  he  was  of the king s seed in edom   
   for it came to pass  when david was in edom  and joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain  after he had smitten every male in edom   
    for six months did joab remain there with all israel  until he had cut off every male in edom    
   that hadad fled  he and certain edomites of his father s servants with him  to go into egypt  hadad  being  yet a little child   
   and they arose out of midian  and came to paran  and they took men with them out of paran  and they came to egypt  unto pharaoh king of egypt  which gave him an house  and appointed him victuals  and gave him land   
   and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh  so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife  the sister of tahpenes the queen   
   and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son  whom tahpenes weaned in pharaoh s house  and genubath was in pharaoh s household among the sons of pharaoh   
   and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers  and that joab the captain of the host was dead  hadad said to pharaoh  let me depart  that i may go to mine own country   
   then pharaoh said unto him  but what hast thou lacked with me  that  behold  thou seekest to go to thine own country  and he answered  nothing  howbeit let me go in any wise   
   and god stirred him up  another  adversary  rezon the son of eliadah  which fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah   
   and he gathered men unto him  and became captain over a band  when david slew them  of zobah   and they went to damascus  and dwelt therein  and reigned in damascus   
   and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon  beside the mischief that hadad  did   and he abhorred israel  and reigned over syria   
    and jeroboam the son of nebat  an ephrathite of zereda  solomon s servant  whose mother s name  was  zeruah  a widow woman  even he lifted up  his  hand against the king   
   and this  was  the cause that he lifted up  his  hand against the king  solomon built millo   and  repaired the breaches of the city of david his father   
   and the man jeroboam  was  a mighty man of valour  and solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious  he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph   
   and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of jerusalem  that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way  and he had clad himself with a new garment  and they two  were  alone in the field   
   and ahijah caught the new garment that  was  on him  and rent it  in  twelve pieces   
   and he said to jeroboam  take thee ten pieces  for thus saith the lord  the god of israel  behold  i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon  and will give ten tribes to thee   
    but he shall have one tribe for my servant david s sake  and for jerusalem s sake  the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel    
   because that they have forsaken me  and have worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians  chemosh the god of the moabites  and milcom the god of the children of ammon  and have not walked in my ways  to do  that which is  right in mine eyes  and  to keep  my statutes and my judgments  as  did  david his father   
   howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand  but i will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servant s sake  whom i chose  because he kept my commandments and my statutes   
   but i will take the kingdom out of his son s hand  and will give it unto thee   even  ten tribes   
   and unto his son will i give one tribe  that david my servant may have a light alway before me in jerusalem  the city which i have chosen me to put my name there   
   and i will take thee  and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth  and shalt be king over israel   
   and it shall be  if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee  and wilt walk in my ways  and do  that is  right in my sight  to keep my statutes and my commandments  as david my servant did  that i will be with thee  and build thee a sure house  as i built for david  and will give israel unto thee   
   and i will for this afflict the seed of david  but not for ever   
   solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam  and jeroboam arose  and fled into egypt  unto shishak king of egypt  and was in egypt until the death of solomon   
    and the rest of the acts of solomon  and all that he did  and his wisdom   are  they not written in the book of the acts of solomon   
   and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel  was  forty years   
   and solomon slept with his fathers  and was buried in the city of david his father  and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead   
  kings    
   and rehoboam went to shechem  for all israel were come to shechem to make him king   
  and it came to pass  when jeroboam the son of nebat  who was yet in egypt  heard  of it    for he was fled from the presence of king solomon  and jeroboam dwelt in egypt    
  that they sent and called him  and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came  and spake unto rehoboam  saying   
  thy father made our yoke grievous  now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father  and his heavy yoke which he put upon us  lighter  and we will serve thee   
  and he said unto them  depart yet  for  three days  then come again to me  and the people departed   
  and king rehoboam consulted with the old men  that stood before solomon his father while he yet lived  and said  how do ye advise that i may answer this people   
  and they spake unto him  saying  if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day  and wilt serve them  and answer them  and speak good words to them  then they will be thy servants for ever   
  but he forsook the counsel of the old men  which they had given him  and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him   and  which stood before him   
  and he said unto them  what counsel give ye that we may answer this people  who have spoken to me  saying  make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter   
   and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him  saying  thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee  saying  thy father made our yoke heavy  but make thou  it  lighter unto us  thus shalt thou say unto them  my little  finger  shall be thicker than my father s loins   
   and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke  i will add to your yoke  my father hath chastised you with whips  but i will chastise you with scorpions   
   so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day  as the king had appointed  saying  come to me again the third day   
   and the king answered the people roughly  and forsook the old men s counsel that they gave him   
   and spake to them after the counsel of the young men  saying  my father made your yoke heavy  and i will add to your yoke  my father  also  chastised you with whips  but i will chastise you with scorpions   
   wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people  for the cause was from the lord  that he might perform his saying  which the lord spake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat   
    so when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them  the people answered the king  saying  what portion have we in david  neither  have we  inheritance in the son of jesse  to your tents  o israel  now see to thine own house  david  so israel departed unto their tents   
   but  as for  the children of israel which dwelt in the cities of judah  rehoboam reigned over them   
   then king rehoboam sent adoram  who  was  over the tribute  and all israel stoned him with stones  that he died  therefore king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot  to flee to jerusalem   
   so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day   
   and it came to pass  when all israel heard that jeroboam was come again  that they sent and called him unto the congregation  and made him king over all israel  there was none that followed the house of david  but the tribe of judah only   
   and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem  he assembled all the house of judah  with the tribe of benjamin  an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men  which were warriors  to fight against the house of israel  to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon   
   but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god  saying   
   speak unto rehoboam  the son of solomon  king of judah  and unto all the house of judah and benjamin  and to the remnant of the people  saying   
   thus saith the lord  ye shall not go up  nor fight against your brethren the children of israel  return every man to his house  for this thing is from me  they hearkened therefore to the word of the lord  and returned to depart  according to the word of the lord   
    then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim  and dwelt therein  and went out from thence  and built penuel   
   and jeroboam said in his heart  now shall the kingdom return to the house of david   
   if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the lord at jerusalem  then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord   even  unto rehoboam king of judah  and they shall kill me  and go again to rehoboam king of judah   
   whereupon the king took counsel  and made two calves  of  gold  and said unto them  it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem  behold thy gods  o israel  which brought thee up out of the land of egypt   
   and he set the one in bethel  and the other put he in dan   
   and this thing became a sin  for the people went  to worship  before the one   even  unto dan   
   and he made an house of high places  and made priests of the lowest of the people  which were not of the sons of levi   
   and jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month  on the fifteenth day of the month  like unto the feast that  is  in judah  and he offered upon the altar  so did he in bethel  sacrificing unto the calves that he had made  and he placed in bethel the priests of the high places which he had made   
   so he offered upon the altar which he had made in bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month   even  in the month which he had devised of his own heart  and ordained a feast unto the children of israel  and he offered upon the altar  and burnt incense   
  kings    
   and  behold  there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel  and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense   
  and he cried against the altar in the word of the lord  and said  o altar  altar  thus saith the lord  behold  a child shall be born unto the house of david  josiah by name  and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee  and men s bones shall be burnt upon thee   
  and he gave a sign the same day  saying  this  is  the sign which the lord hath spoken  behold  the altar shall be rent  and the ashes that  are  upon it shall be poured out   
  and it came to pass  when king jeroboam heard the saying of the man of god  which had cried against the altar in bethel  that he put forth his hand from the altar  saying  lay hold on him  and his hand  which he put forth against him  dried up  so that he could not pull it in again to him   
  the altar also was rent  and the ashes poured out from the altar  according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord   
  and the king answered and said unto the man of god  intreat now the face of the lord thy god  and pray for me  that my hand may be restored me again  and the man of god besought the lord  and the king s hand was restored him again  and became as  it was  before   
  and the king said unto the man of god  come home with me  and refresh thyself  and i will give thee a reward   
  and the man of god said unto the king  if thou wilt give me half thine house  i will not go in with thee  neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place   
  for so was it charged me by the word of the lord  saying  eat no bread  nor drink water  nor turn again by the same way that thou camest   
   so he went another way  and returned not by the way that he came to bethel   
    now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel  and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in bethel  the words which he had spoken unto the king  them they told also to their father   
   and their father said unto them  what way went he  for his sons had seen what way the man of god went  which came from judah   
   and he said unto his sons  saddle me the ass  so they saddled him the ass  and he rode thereon   
   and went after the man of god  and found him sitting under an oak  and he said unto him   art  thou the man of god that camest from judah  and he said  i  am    
   then he said unto him  come home with me  and eat bread   
   and he said  i may not return with thee  nor go in with thee  neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place   
   for it was said to me by the word of the lord  thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there  nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest   
   he said unto him  i  am  a prophet also as thou  art   and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord  saying  bring him back with thee into thine house  that he may eat bread and drink water   but  he lied unto him   
   so he went back with him  and did eat bread in his house  and drank water   
   and it came to pass  as they sat at the table  that the word of the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back   
   and he cried unto the man of god that came from judah  saying  thus saith the lord  forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord  and hast not kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee   
   but camest back  and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place  of the which  the lord  did say to thee  eat no bread  and drink no water  thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers   
    and it came to pass  after he had eaten bread  and after he had drunk  that he saddled for him the ass   to wit   for the prophet whom he had brought back   
   and when he was gone  a lion met him by the way  and slew him  and his carcase was cast in the way  and the ass stood by it  the lion also stood by the carcase   
   and  behold  men passed by  and saw the carcase cast in the way  and the lion standing by the carcase  and they came and told  it  in the city where the old prophet dwelt   
   and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard  thereof   he said  it  is  the man of god  who was disobedient unto the word of the lord  therefore the lord hath delivered him unto the lion  which hath torn him  and slain him  according to the word of the lord  which he spake unto him   
   and he spake to his sons  saying  saddle me the ass  and they saddled  him    
   and he went and found his carcase cast in the way  and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase  the lion had not eaten the carcase  nor torn the ass   
   and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of god  and laid it upon the ass  and brought it back  and the old prophet came to the city  to mourn and to bury him   
   and he laid his carcase in his own grave  and they mourned over him   saying   alas  my brother   
   and it came to pass  after he had buried him  that he spake to his sons  saying  when i am dead  then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god  is  buried  lay my bones beside his bones   
   for the saying which he cried by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel  and against all the houses of the high places which  are  in the cities of samaria  shall surely come to pass   
   after this thing jeroboam returned not from his evil way  but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places  whosoever would  he consecrated him  and he became  one  of the priests of the high places   
   and this thing became sin unto the house of jeroboam  even to cut  it  off  and to destroy  it  from off the face of the earth   
  kings    
   at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick   
  and jeroboam said to his wife  arise  i pray thee  and disguise thyself  that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam  and get thee to shiloh  behold  there  is  ahijah the prophet  which told me that  i should be  king over this people   
  and take with thee ten loaves  and cracknels  and a cruse of honey  and go to him  he shall tell thee what shall become of the child   
  and jeroboam s wife did so  and arose  and went to shiloh  and came to the house of ahijah  but ahijah could not see  for his eyes were set by reason of his age   
  and the lord said unto ahijah  behold  the wife of jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son  for he  is  sick  thus and thus shalt thou say unto her  for it shall be  when she cometh in  that she shall feign herself  to be  another  woman    
  and it was  so   when ahijah heard the sound of her feet  as she came in at the door  that he said  come in  thou wife of jeroboam  why feignest thou thyself  to be  another  for i  am  sent to thee  with  heavy  tidings    
   go  tell jeroboam  thus saith the lord god of israel  forasmuch as i exalted thee from among the people  and made thee prince over my people israel   
  and rent the kingdom away from the house of david  and gave it thee  and  yet  thou hast not been as my servant david  who kept my commandments  and who followed me with all his heart  to do  that  only  which was  right in mine eyes   
  but hast done evil above all that were before thee  for thou hast gone and made thee other gods  and molten images  to provoke me to anger  and hast cast me behind thy back   
   therefore  behold  i will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam  and will cut off from jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall   and  him that is shut up and left in israel  and will take away the remnant of the house of jeroboam  as a man taketh away dung  till it be all gone   
   him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat  and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat  for the lord hath spoken  it    
   arise thou therefore  get thee to thine own house   and  when thy feet enter into the city  the child shall die   
   and all israel shall mourn for him  and bury him  for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave  because in him there is found  some  good thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam   
   moreover the lord shall raise him up a king over israel  who shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day  but what  even now   
   for the lord shall smite israel  as a reed is shaken in the water  and he shall root up israel out of this good land  which he gave to their fathers  and shall scatter them beyond the river  because they have made their groves  provoking the lord to anger   
   and he shall give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam  who did sin  and who made israel to sin   
   and jeroboam s wife arose  and departed  and came to tirzah   and  when she came to the threshold of the door  the child died   
   and they buried him  and all israel mourned for him  according to the word of the lord  which he spake by the hand of his servant ahijah the prophet   
   and the rest of the acts of jeroboam  how he warred  and how he reigned  behold  they  are  written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   and the days which jeroboam reigned  were  two and twenty years  and he slept with his fathers  and nadab his son reigned in his stead   
    and rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah  rehoboam  was  forty and one years old when he began to reign  and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem  the city which the lord did choose out of all the tribes of israel  to put his name there  and his mother s name  was  naamah an ammonitess   
   and judah did evil in the sight of the lord  and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed  above all that their fathers had done   
   for they also built them high places  and images  and groves  on every high hill  and under every green tree   
   and there were also sodomites in the land   and  they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the lord cast out before the children of israel   
   and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam   that  shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem   
   and he took away the treasures of the house of the lord  and the treasures of the king s house  he even took away all  and he took away all the shields of gold which solomon had made   
   and king rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields  and committed  them  unto the hands of the chief of the guard  which kept the door of the king s house   
   and it was  so   when the king went into the house of the lord  that the guard bare them  and brought them back into the guard chamber   
   now the rest of the acts of rehoboam  and all that he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
   and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all  their  days   
   and rehoboam slept with his fathers  and was buried with his fathers in the city of david  and his mother s name  was  naamah an ammonitess  and abijam his son reigned in his stead   
  kings    
   now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat reigned abijam over judah   
  three years reigned he in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  maachah  the daughter of abishalom   
  and he walked in all the sins of his father  which he had done before him  and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god  as the heart of david his father   
  nevertheless for david s sake did the lord his god give him a lamp in jerusalem  to set up his son after him  and to establish jerusalem   
  because david did  that which was  right in the eyes of the lord  and turned not aside from any  thing  that he commanded him all the days of his life  save only in the matter of uriah the hittite   
  and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of his life   
  now the rest of the acts of abijam  and all that he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah  and there was war between abijam and jeroboam   
  and abijam slept with his fathers  and they buried him in the city of david  and asa his son reigned in his stead   
   and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel reigned asa over judah   
   and forty and one years reigned he in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  maachah  the daughter of abishalom   
   and asa did  that which was  right in the eyes of the lord  as  did  david his father   
   and he took away the sodomites out of the land  and removed all the idols that his fathers had made   
   and also maachah his mother  even her he removed from  being  queen  because she had made an idol in a grove  and asa destroyed her idol  and burnt  it  by the brook kidron   
   but the high places were not removed  nevertheless asa s heart was perfect with the lord all his days   
   and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated  and the things which himself had dedicated  into the house of the lord  silver  and gold  and vessels   
   and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days   
   and baasha king of israel went up against judah  and built ramah  that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king of judah   
   then asa took all the silver and the gold  that were  left in the treasures of the house of the lord  and the treasures of the king s house  and delivered them into the hand of his servants  and king asa sent them to benhadad  the son of tabrimon  the son of hezion  king of syria  that dwelt at damascus  saying   
    there is  a league between me and thee   and  between my father and thy father  behold  i have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold  come and break thy league with baasha king of israel  that he may depart from me   
   so benhadad hearkened unto king asa  and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of israel  and smote ijon  and dan  and abelbethmaachah  and all cinneroth  with all the land of naphtali   
   and it came to pass  when baasha heard  thereof   that he left off building of ramah  and dwelt in tirzah   
   then king asa made a proclamation throughout all judah  none  was  exempted  and they took away the stones of ramah  and the timber thereof  wherewith baasha had builded  and king asa built with them geba of benjamin  and mizpah   
   the rest of all the acts of asa  and all his might  and all that he did  and the cities which he built   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah  nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet   
   and asa slept with his fathers  and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father  and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead   
    and nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the second year of asa king of judah  and reigned over israel two years   
   and he did evil in the sight of the lord  and walked in the way of his father  and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin   
   and baasha the son of ahijah  of the house of issachar  conspired against him  and baasha smote him at gibbethon  which  belonged  to the philistines  for nadab and all israel laid siege to gibbethon   
   even in the third year of asa king of judah did baasha slay him  and reigned in his stead   
   and it came to pass  when he reigned   that  he smote all the house of jeroboam  he left not to jeroboam any that breathed  until he had destroyed him  according unto the saying of the lord  which he spake by his servant ahijah the shilonite   
   because of the sins of jeroboam which he sinned  and which he made israel sin  by his provocation wherewith he provoked the lord god of israel to anger   
   now the rest of the acts of nadab  and all that he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days   
   in the third year of asa king of judah began baasha the son of ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah  twenty and four years   
   and he did evil in the sight of the lord  and walked in the way of jeroboam  and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin   
  kings    
   then the word of the lord came to jehu the son of hanani against baasha  saying   
  forasmuch as i exalted thee out of the dust  and made thee prince over my people israel  and thou hast walked in the way of jeroboam  and hast made my people israel to sin  to provoke me to anger with their sins   
  behold  i will take away the posterity of baasha  and the posterity of his house  and will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat   
  him that dieth of baasha in the city shall the dogs eat  and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat   
  now the rest of the acts of baasha  and what he did  and his might   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
  so baasha slept with his fathers  and was buried in tirzah  and elah his son reigned in his stead   
  and also by the hand of the prophet jehu the son of hanani came the word of the lord against baasha  and against his house  even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the lord  in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands  in being like the house of jeroboam  and because he killed him   
  in the twenty and sixth year of asa king of judah began elah the son of baasha to reign over israel in tirzah  two years   
  and his servant zimri  captain of half  his  chariots  conspired against him  as he was in tirzah  drinking himself drunk in the house of arza steward of  his  house in tirzah   
   and zimri went in and smote him  and killed him  in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah  and reigned in his stead   
   and it came to pass  when he began to reign  as soon as he sat on his throne   that  he slew all the house of baasha  he left him not one that pisseth against a wall  neither of his kinsfolks  nor of his friends   
   thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasha  according to the word of the lord  which he spake against baasha by jehu the prophet   
   for all the sins of baasha  and the sins of elah his son  by which they sinned  and by which they made israel to sin  in provoking the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities   
   now the rest of the acts of elah  and all that he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
    in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri reign seven days in tirzah  and the people  were  encamped against gibbethon  which  belonged  to the philistines   
   and the people  that were  encamped heard say  zimri hath conspired  and hath also slain the king  wherefore all israel made omri  the captain of the host  king over israel that day in the camp   
   and omri went up from gibbethon  and all israel with him  and they besieged tirzah   
   and it came to pass  when zimri saw that the city was taken  that he went into the palace of the king s house  and burnt the king s house over him with fire  and died   
   for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the lord  in walking in the way of jeroboam  and in his sin which he did  to make israel to sin   
   now the rest of the acts of zimri  and his treason that he wrought   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   then were the people of israel divided into two parts  half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath  to make him king  and half followed omri   
   but the people that followed omri prevailed against the people that followed tibni the son of ginath  so tibni died  and omri reigned   
   in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah began omri to reign over israel  twelve years  six years reigned he in tirzah   
   and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of silver  and built on the hill  and called the name of the city which he built  after the name of shemer  owner of the hill  samaria   
   but omri wrought evil in the eyes of the lord  and did worse than all that  were  before him   
   for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat  and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin  to provoke the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities   
   now the rest of the acts of omri which he did  and his might that he shewed   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   so omri slept with his fathers  and was buried in samaria  and ahab his son reigned in his stead   
    and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel  and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years   
   and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above all that  were  before him   
   and it came to pass  as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat  that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians  and went and served baal  and worshipped him   
   and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal  which he had built in samaria   
   and ahab made a grove  and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him   
   in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho  he laid the foundation thereof in abiram his firstborn  and set up the gates thereof in his youngest  son  segub  according to the word of the lord  which he spake by joshua the son of nun   
  kings    
   and elijah the tishbite   who was  of the inhabitants of gilead  said unto ahab   as  the lord god of israel liveth  before whom i stand  there shall not be dew nor rain these years  but according to my word   
  and the word of the lord came unto him  saying   
  get thee hence  and turn thee eastward  and hide thyself by the brook cherith  that  is  before jordan   
  and it shall be   that  thou shalt drink of the brook  and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there   
  so he went and did according unto the word of the lord  for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith  that  is  before jordan   
  and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning  and bread and flesh in the evening  and he drank of the brook   
  and it came to pass after a while  that the brook dried up  because there had been no rain in the land   
   and the word of the lord came unto him  saying   
  arise  get thee to zarephath  which  belongeth  to zidon  and dwell there  behold  i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee   
   so he arose and went to zarephath  and when he came to the gate of the city  behold  the widow woman  was  there gathering of sticks  and he called to her  and said  fetch me  i pray thee  a little water in a vessel  that i may drink   
   and as she was going to fetch  it   he called to her  and said  bring me  i pray thee  a morsel of bread in thine hand   
   and she said   as  the lord thy god liveth  i have not a cake  but an handful of meal in a barrel  and a little oil in a cruse  and  behold  i  am  gathering two sticks  that i may go in and dress it for me and my son  that we may eat it  and die   
   and elijah said unto her  fear not  go  and  do as thou hast said  but make me thereof a little cake first  and bring  it  unto me  and after make for thee and for thy son   
   for thus saith the lord god of israel  the barrel of meal shall not waste  neither shall the cruse of oil fail  until the day  that  the lord sendeth rain upon the earth   
   and she went and did according to the saying of elijah  and she  and he  and her house  did eat  many  days   
    and  the barrel of meal wasted not  neither did the cruse of oil fail  according to the word of the lord  which he spake by elijah   
    and it came to pass after these things   that  the son of the woman  the mistress of the house  fell sick  and his sickness was so sore  that there was no breath left in him   
   and she said unto elijah  what have i to do with thee  o thou man of god  art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance  and to slay my son   
   and he said unto her  give me thy son  and he took him out of her bosom  and carried him up into a loft  where he abode  and laid him upon his own bed   
   and he cried unto the lord  and said  o lord my god  hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn  by slaying her son   
   and he stretched himself upon the child three times  and cried unto the lord  and said  o lord my god  i pray thee  let this child s soul come into him again   
   and the lord heard the voice of elijah  and the soul of the child came into him again  and he revived   
   and elijah took the child  and brought him down out of the chamber into the house  and delivered him unto his mother  and elijah said  see  thy son liveth   
   and the woman said to elijah  now by this i know that thou  art  a man of god   and  that the word of the lord in thy mouth  is  truth   
  kings    
   and it came to pass  after  many days  that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year  saying  go  shew thyself unto ahab  and i will send rain upon the earth   
  and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab  and  there was  a sore famine in samaria   
  and ahab called obadiah  which  was  the governor of  his  house   now obadiah feared the lord greatly   
  for it was  so   when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord  that obadiah took an hundred prophets  and hid them by fifty in a cave  and fed them with bread and water    
  and ahab said unto obadiah  go into the land  unto all fountains of water  and unto all brooks  peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive  that we lose not all the beasts   
  so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it  ahab went one way by himself  and obadiah went another way by himself   
  and as obadiah was in the way  behold  elijah met him  and he knew him  and fell on his face  and said   art  thou that my lord elijah   
  and he answered him  i  am   go  tell thy lord  behold  elijah  is here    
  and he said  what have i sinned  that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab  to slay me   
    as  the lord thy god liveth  there is no nation or kingdom  whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee  and when they said   he is  not  there   he took an oath of the kingdom and nation  that they found thee not   
   and now thou sayest  go  tell thy lord  behold  elijah  is here    
   and it shall come to pass   as soon as  i am gone from thee  that the spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not  and  so  when i come and tell ahab  and he cannot find thee  he shall slay me  but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth   
   was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of the lord  how i hid an hundred men of the lord s prophets by fifty in a cave  and fed them with bread and water   
   and now thou sayest  go  tell thy lord  behold  elijah  is here   and he shall slay me   
   and elijah said   as  the lord of hosts liveth  before whom i stand  i will surely shew myself unto him to day   
   so obadiah went to meet ahab  and told him  and ahab went to meet elijah   
    and it came to pass  when ahab saw elijah  that ahab said unto him   art  thou he that troubleth israel   
   and he answered  i have not troubled israel  but thou  and thy father s house  in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord  and thou hast followed baalim   
   now therefore send   and  gather to me all israel unto mount carmel  and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty  and the prophets of the groves four hundred  which eat at jezebel s table   
   so ahab sent unto all the children of israel  and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel   
    and elijah came unto all the people  and said  how long halt ye between two opinions  if the lord  be  god  follow him  but if baal   then  follow him  and the people answered him not a word   
   then said elijah unto the people  i   even  i only  remain a prophet of the lord  but baal s prophets  are  four hundred and fifty men   
   let them therefore give us two bullocks  and let them choose one bullock for themselves  and cut it in pieces  and lay  it  on wood  and put no fire  under   and i will dress the other bullock  and lay  it  on wood  and put no fire  under    
   and call ye on the name of your gods  and i will call on the name of the lord  and the god that answereth by fire  let him be god  and all the people answered and said  it is well spoken   
   and elijah said unto the prophets of baal  choose you one bullock for yourselves  and dress  it  first  for ye  are  many  and call on the name of your gods  but put no fire  under    
   and they took the bullock which was given them  and they dressed  it   and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon  saying  o baal  hear us  but  there was  no voice  nor any that answered  and they leaped upon the altar which was made   
   and it came to pass at noon  that elijah mocked them  and said  cry aloud  for he  is  a god  either he is talking  or he is pursuing  or he is in a journey   or  peradventure he sleepeth  and must be awaked   
   and they cried aloud  and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets  till the blood gushed out upon them   
   and it came to pass  when midday was past  and they prophesied until the  time  of the offering of the  evening  sacrifice  that  there was  neither voice  nor any to answer  nor any that regarded   
   and elijah said unto all the people  come near unto me  and all the people came near unto him  and he repaired the altar of the lord  that was  broken down   
   and elijah took twelve stones  according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob  unto whom the word of the lord came  saying  israel shall be thy name   
   and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord  and he made a trench about the altar  as great as would contain two measures of seed   
   and he put the wood in order  and cut the bullock in pieces  and laid  him  on the wood  and said  fill four barrels with water  and pour  it  on the burnt sacrifice  and on the wood   
   and he said  do  it  the second time  and they did  it  the second time  and he said  do  it  the third time  and they did  it  the third time   
   and the water ran round about the altar  and he filled the trench also with water   
   and it came to pass at  the time of  the offering of the  evening  sacrifice  that elijah the prophet came near  and said  lord god of abraham  isaac  and of israel  let it be known this day that thou  art  god in israel  and  that  i  am  thy servant  and  that  i have done all these things at thy word   
   hear me  o lord  hear me  that this people may know that thou  art  the lord god  and  that  thou hast turned their heart back again   
   then the fire of the lord fell  and consumed the burnt sacrifice  and the wood  and the stones  and the dust  and licked up the water that  was  in the trench   
   and when all the people saw  it   they fell on their faces  and they said  the lord  he  is  the god  the lord  he  is  the god   
   and elijah said unto them  take the prophets of baal  let not one of them escape  and they took them  and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon  and slew them there   
    and elijah said unto ahab  get thee up  eat and drink  for  there is  a sound of abundance of rain   
   so ahab went up to eat and to drink  and elijah went up to the top of carmel  and he cast himself down upon the earth  and put his face between his knees   
   and said to his servant  go up now  look toward the sea  and he went up  and looked  and said   there is  nothing  and he said  go again seven times   
   and it came to pass at the seventh time  that he said  behold  there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea  like a man s hand  and he said  go up  say unto ahab  prepare  thy chariot   and get thee down  that the rain stop thee not   
   and it came to pass in the mean while  that the heaven was black with clouds and wind  and there was a great rain  and ahab rode  and went to jezreel   
   and the hand of the lord was on elijah  and he girded up his loins  and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel   
  kings    
   and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done  and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword   
  then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah  saying  so let the gods do  to me   and more also  if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time   
  and when he saw  that   he arose  and went for his life  and came to beersheba  which  belongeth  to judah  and left his servant there   
  but he himself went a day s journey into the wilderness  and came and sat down under a juniper tree  and he requested for himself that he might die  and said  it is enough  now  o lord  take away my life  for i  am  not better than my fathers   
  and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree  behold  then an angel touched him  and said unto him  arise  and  eat   
  and he looked  and  behold   there was  a cake baken on the coals  and a cruse of water at his head  and he did eat and drink  and laid him down again   
  and the angel of the lord came again the second time  and touched him  and said  arise  and  eat  because the journey  is  too great for thee   
  and he arose  and did eat and drink  and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god   
   and he came thither unto a cave  and lodged there  and  behold  the word of the lord  came  to him  and he said unto him  what doest thou here  elijah   
   and he said  i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts  for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant  thrown down thine altars  and slain thy prophets with the sword  and i   even  i only  am left  and they seek my life  to take it away   
   and he said  go forth  and stand upon the mount before the lord  and  behold  the lord passed by  and a great and strong wind rent the mountains  and brake in pieces the rocks before the lord   but  the lord  was  not in the wind  and after the wind an earthquake   but  the lord  was  not in the earthquake   
   and after the earthquake a fire   but  the lord  was  not in the fire  and after the fire a still small voice   
   and it was  so   when elijah heard  it   that he wrapped his face in his mantle  and went out  and stood in the entering in of the cave  and  behold   there came  a voice unto him  and said  what doest thou here  elijah   
   and he said  i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts  because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant  thrown down thine altars  and slain thy prophets with the sword  and i   even  i only  am left  and they seek my life  to take it away   
   and the lord said unto him  go  return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus  and when thou comest  anoint hazael  to be  king over syria   
   and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint  to be  king over israel  and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt thou anoint  to be  prophet in thy room   
   and it shall come to pass   that  him that escapeth the sword of hazael shall jehu slay  and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay   
   yet i have left  me  seven thousand in israel  all the knees which have not bowed unto baal  and every mouth which hath not kissed him   
    so he departed thence  and found elisha the son of shaphat  who  was  plowing  with  twelve yoke  of oxen  before him  and he with the twelfth  and elijah passed by him  and cast his mantle upon him   
   and he left the oxen  and ran after elijah  and said  let me  i pray thee  kiss my father and my mother  and  then  i will follow thee  and he said unto him  go back again  for what have i done to thee   
   and he returned back from him  and took a yoke of oxen  and slew them  and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen  and gave unto the people  and they did eat  then he arose  and went after elijah  and ministered unto him   
  kings    
   and benhadad the king of syria gathered all his host together  and  there were  thirty and two kings with him  and horses  and chariots  and he went up and besieged samaria  and warred against it   
  and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city  and said unto him  thus saith benhadad   
  thy silver and thy gold  is  mine  thy wives also and thy children   even  the goodliest   are  mine   
  and the king of israel answered and said  my lord  o king  according to thy saying  i  am  thine  and all that i have   
  and the messengers came again  and said  thus speaketh benhadad  saying  although i have sent unto thee  saying  thou shalt deliver me thy silver  and thy gold  and thy wives  and thy children   
  yet i will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time  and they shall search thine house  and the houses of thy servants  and it shall be   that  whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes  they shall put  it  in their hand  and take  it  away   
  then the king of israel called all the elders of the land  and said  mark  i pray you  and see how this  man  seeketh mischief  for he sent unto me for my wives  and for my children  and for my silver  and for my gold  and i denied him not   
  and all the elders and all the people said unto him  hearken not  unto him   nor consent   
  wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad  tell my lord the king  all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i will do  but this thing i may not do  and the messengers departed  and brought him word again   
   and benhadad sent unto him  and said  the gods do so unto me  and more also  if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me   
   and the king of israel answered and said  tell  him   let not him that girdeth on  his harness  boast himself as he that putteth it off   
    and it came to pass  when  benhadad  heard this message  as he  was  drinking  he and the kings in the pavilions  that he said unto his servants  set  yourselves in array   and they set  themselves in array  against the city   
   and  behold  there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel  saying  thus saith the lord  hast thou seen all this great multitude  behold  i will deliver it into thine hand this day  and thou shalt know that i  am  the lord   
   and ahab said  by whom  and he said  thus saith the lord   even  by the young men of the princes of the provinces  then he said  who shall order the battle  and he answered  thou   
   then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces  and they were two hundred and thirty two  and after them he numbered all the people   even  all the children of israel   being  seven thousand   
   and they went out at noon  but benhadad  was  drinking himself drunk in the pavilions  he and the kings  the thirty and two kings that helped him   
   and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first  and benhadad sent out  and they told him  saying  there are men come out of samaria   
   and he said  whether they be come out for peace  take them alive  or whether they be come out for war  take them alive   
   so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city  and the army which followed them   
   and they slew every one his man  and the syrians fled  and israel pursued them  and benhadad the king of syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen   
   and the king of israel went out  and smote the horses and chariots  and slew the syrians with a great slaughter   
    and the prophet came to the king of israel  and said unto him  go  strengthen thyself  and mark  and see what thou doest  for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee   
   and the servants of the king of syria said unto him  their gods  are  gods of the hills  therefore they were stronger than we  but let us fight against them in the plain  and surely we shall be stronger than they   
   and do this thing  take the kings away  every man out of his place  and put captains in their rooms   
   and number thee an army  like the army that thou hast lost  horse for horse  and chariot for chariot  and we will fight against them in the plain   and  surely we shall be stronger than they  and he hearkened unto their voice  and did so   
   and it came to pass at the return of the year  that benhadad numbered the syrians  and went up to aphek  to fight against israel   
   and the children of israel were numbered  and were all present  and went against them  and the children of israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids  but the syrians filled the country   
   and there came a man of god  and spake unto the king of israel  and said  thus saith the lord  because the syrians have said  the lord  is  god of the hills  but he  is  not god of the valleys  therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord   
   and they pitched one over against the other seven days  and  so  it was  that in the seventh day the battle was joined  and the children of israel slew of the syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day   
   but the rest fled to aphek  into the city  and  there  a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men  that were  left  and benhadad fled  and came into the city  into an inner chamber   
    and his servants said unto him  behold now  we have heard that the kings of the house of israel  are  merciful kings  let us  i pray thee  put sackcloth on our loins  and ropes upon our heads  and go out to the king of israel  peradventure he will save thy life   
   so they girded sackcloth on their loins  and  put  ropes on their heads  and came to the king of israel  and said  thy servant benhadad saith  i pray thee  let me live  and he said   is  he yet alive  he  is  my brother   
   now the men did diligently observe whether  any thing would come  from him  and did hastily catch  it   and they said  thy brother benhadad  then he said  go ye  bring him  then benhadad came forth to him  and he caused him to come up into the chariot   
   and  benhadad  said unto him  the cities  which my father took from thy father  i will restore  and thou shalt make streets for thee in damascus  as my father made in samaria  then  said ahab   i will send thee away with this covenant  so he made a covenant with him  and sent him away   
   and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the lord  smite me  i pray thee  and the man refused to smite him   
   then said he unto him  because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the lord  behold  as soon as thou art departed from me  a lion shall slay thee  and as soon as he was departed from him  a lion found him  and slew him   
   then he found another man  and said  smite me  i pray thee  and the man smote him  so that in smiting he wounded  him    
   so the prophet departed  and waited for the king by the way  and disguised himself with ashes upon his face   
   and as the king passed by  he cried unto the king  and he said  thy servant went out into the midst of the battle  and  behold  a man turned aside  and brought a man unto me  and said  keep this man  if by any means he be missing  then shall thy life be for his life  or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver   
   and as thy servant was busy here and there  he was gone  and the king of israel said unto him  so  shall  thy judgment  be   thyself hast decided  it    
   and he hasted  and took the ashes away from his face  and the king of israel discerned him that he  was  of the prophets   
   and he said unto him  thus saith the lord  because thou hast let go out of  thy  hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction  therefore thy life shall go for his life  and thy people for his people   
   and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased  and came to samaria   
  kings    
   and it came to pass after these things   that  naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard  which  was  in jezreel  hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria   
  and ahab spake unto naboth  saying  give me thy vineyard  that i may have it for a garden of herbs  because it  is  near unto my house  and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it   or   if it seem good to thee  i will give thee the worth of it in money   
  and naboth said to ahab  the lord forbid it me  that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee   
  and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him  for he had said  i will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers  and he laid him down upon his bed  and turned away his face  and would eat no bread   
   but jezebel his wife came to him  and said unto him  why is thy spirit so sad  that thou eatest no bread   
  and he said unto her  because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite  and said unto him  give me thy vineyard for money  or else  if it please thee  i will give thee  another  vineyard for it  and he answered  i will not give thee my vineyard   
  and jezebel his wife said unto him  dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel  arise   and  eat bread  and let thine heart be merry  i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite   
  so she wrote letters in ahab s name  and sealed  them  with his seal  and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that  were  in his city  dwelling with naboth   
  and she wrote in the letters  saying  proclaim a fast  and set naboth on high among the people   
   and set two men  sons of belial  before him  to bear witness against him  saying  thou didst blaspheme god and the king  and  then  carry him out  and stone him  that he may die   
   and the men of his city   even  the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city  did as jezebel had sent unto them   and  as it  was  written in the letters which she had sent unto them   
   they proclaimed a fast  and set naboth on high among the people   
   and there came in two men  children of belial  and sat before him  and the men of belial witnessed against him   even  against naboth  in the presence of the people  saying  naboth did blaspheme god and the king  then they carried him forth out of the city  and stoned him with stones  that he died   
   then they sent to jezebel  saying  naboth is stoned  and is dead   
   and it came to pass  when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned  and was dead  that jezebel said to ahab  arise  take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite  which he refused to give thee for money  for naboth is not alive  but dead   
   and it came to pass  when ahab heard that naboth was dead  that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite  to take possession of it   
    and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite  saying   
   arise  go down to meet ahab king of israel  which  is  in samaria  behold   he is  in the vineyard of naboth  whither he is gone down to possess it   
   and thou shalt speak unto him  saying  thus saith the lord  hast thou killed  and also taken possession  and thou shalt speak unto him  saying  thus saith the lord  in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood  even thine   
   and ahab said to elijah  hast thou found me  o mine enemy  and he answered  i have found  thee   because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord   
   behold  i will bring evil upon thee  and will take away thy posterity  and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall  and him that is shut up and left in israel   
   and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat  and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah  for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked  me  to anger  and made israel to sin   
   and of jezebel also spake the lord  saying  the dogs shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel   
   him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat  and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat   
   but there was none like unto ahab  which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord  whom jezebel his wife stirred up   
   and he did very abominably in following idols  according to all  things  as did the amorites  whom the lord cast out before the children of israel   
   and it came to pass  when ahab heard those words  that he rent his clothes  and put sackcloth upon his flesh  and fasted  and lay in sackcloth  and went softly   
   and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite  saying   
   seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me  because he humbleth himself before me  i will not bring the evil in his days   but  in his son s days will i bring the evil upon his house   
  kings    
   and they continued three years without war between syria and israel   
  and it came to pass in the third year  that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel   
  and the king of israel said unto his servants  know ye that ramoth in gilead  is  ours  and we  be  still   and  take it not out of the hand of the king of syria   
  and he said unto jehoshaphat  wilt thou go with me to battle to ramothgilead  and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel  i  am  as thou  art   my people as thy people  my horses as thy horses   
  and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel  enquire  i pray thee  at the word of the lord to day   
  then the king of israel gathered the prophets together  about four hundred men  and said unto them  shall i go against ramothgilead to battle  or shall i forbear  and they said  go up  for the lord shall deliver  it  into the hand of the king   
  and jehoshaphat said   is there  not here a prophet of the lord besides  that we might enquire of him   
  and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat   there is  yet one man  micaiah the son of imlah  by whom we may enquire of the lord  but i hate him  for he doth not prophesy good concerning me  but evil  and jehoshaphat said  let not the king say so   
  then the king of israel called an officer  and said  hasten  hither  micaiah the son of imlah   
   and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne  having put on their robes  in a void place in the entrance of the gate of samaria  and all the prophets prophesied before them   
   and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron  and he said  thus saith the lord  with these shalt thou push the syrians  until thou have consumed them   
   and all the prophets prophesied so  saying  go up to ramothgilead  and prosper  for the lord shall deliver  it  into the king s hand   
   and the messenger that was gone to call micaiah spake unto him  saying  behold now  the words of the prophets  declare  good unto the king with one mouth  let thy word  i pray thee  be like the word of one of them  and speak  that which is  good   
   and micaiah said   as  the lord liveth  what the lord saith unto me  that will i speak   
    so he came to the king  and the king said unto him  micaiah  shall we go against ramothgilead to battle  or shall we forbear  and he answered him  go  and prosper  for the lord shall deliver  it  into the hand of the king   
   and the king said unto him  how many times shall i adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but  that which is  true in the name of the lord   
   and he said  i saw all israel scattered upon the hills  as sheep that have not a shepherd  and the lord said  these have no master  let them return every man to his house in peace   
   and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat  did i not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me  but evil   
   and he said  hear thou therefore the word of the lord  i saw the lord sitting on his throne  and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left   
   and the lord said  who shall persuade ahab  that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead  and one said on this manner  and another said on that manner   
   and there came forth a spirit  and stood before the lord  and said  i will persuade him   
   and the lord said unto him  wherewith  and he said  i will go forth  and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets  and he said  thou shalt persuade  him   and prevail also  go forth  and do so   
   now therefore  behold  the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets  and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee   
   but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near  and smote micaiah on the cheek  and said  which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee   
   and micaiah said  behold  thou shalt see in that day  when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself   
   and the king of israel said  take micaiah  and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city  and to joash the king s son   
   and say  thus saith the king  put this  fellow  in the prison  and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction  until i come in peace   
   and micaiah said  if thou return at all in peace  the lord hath not spoken by me  and he said  hearken  o people  every one of you   
    so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead   
   and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat  i will disguise myself  and enter into the battle  but put thou on thy robes  and the king of israel disguised himself  and went into the battle   
   but the king of syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots  saying  fight neither with small nor great  save only with the king of israel   
   and it came to pass  when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat  that they said  surely it  is  the king of israel  and they turned aside to fight against him  and jehoshaphat cried out   
   and it came to pass  when the captains of the chariots perceived that it  was  not the king of israel  that they turned back from pursuing him   
   and a  certain  man drew a bow at a venture  and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness  wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot  turn thine hand  and carry me out of the host  for i am wounded   
   and the battle increased that day  and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the syrians  and died at even  and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot   
   and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun  saying  every man to his city  and every man to his own country   
   so the king died  and was brought to samaria  and they buried the king in samaria   
   and  one  washed the chariot in the pool of samaria  and the dogs licked up his blood  and they washed his armour  according unto the word of the lord which he spake   
   now the rest of the acts of ahab  and all that he did  and the ivory house which he made  and all the cities that he built   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   so ahab slept with his fathers  and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead   
    and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel   
   jehoshaphat  was  thirty and five years old when he began to reign  and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  azubah the daughter of shilhi   
   and he walked in all the ways of asa his father  he turned not aside from it  doing  that which was  right in the eyes of the lord  nevertheless the high places were not taken away   for  the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places   
   and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel   
   now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat  and his might that he shewed  and how he warred   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
   and the remnant of the sodomites  which remained in the days of his father asa  he took out of the land   
    there was  then no king in edom  a deputy  was  king   
   jehoshaphat made ships of tharshish to go to ophir for gold  but they went not  for the ships were broken at eziongeber   
   then said ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat  let my servants go with thy servants in the ships  but jehoshaphat would not   
   and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers  and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father  and jehoram his son reigned in his stead   
   ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah  and reigned two years over israel   
   and he did evil in the sight of the lord  and walked in the way of his father  and in the way of his mother  and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat  who made israel to sin   
   for he served baal  and worshipped him  and provoked to anger the lord god of israel  according to all that his father had done   
 
  kings 
  kings   
   then moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab   
  and ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that  was  in samaria  and was sick  and he sent messengers  and said unto them  go  enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron whether i shall recover of this disease   
  but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite  arise  go up to meet the messengers of the king of samaria  and say unto them   is it  not because  there is  not a god in israel   that  ye go to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron   
  now therefore thus saith the lord  thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up  but shalt surely die  and elijah departed   
  and when the messengers turned back unto him  he said unto them  why are ye now turned back   
  and they said unto him  there came a man up to meet us  and said unto us  go  turn again unto the king that sent you  and say unto him  thus saith the lord   is it  not because  there is  not a god in israel   that  thou sendest to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron  therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up  but shalt surely die   
  and he said unto them  what manner of man  was he  which came up to meet you  and told you these words   
  and they answered him   he was  an hairy man  and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins  and he said  it  is  elijah the tishbite   
   then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty  and he went up to him  and  behold  he sat on the top of an hill  and he spake unto him  thou man of god  the king hath said  come down   
   and elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty  if i  be  a man of god  then let fire come down from heaven  and consume thee and thy fifty  and there came down fire from heaven  and consumed him and his fifty   
   again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty  and he answered and said unto him  o man of god  thus hath the king said  come down quickly   
   and elijah answered and said unto them  if i  be  a man of god  let fire come down from heaven  and consume thee and thy fifty  and the fire of god came down from heaven  and consumed him and his fifty   
   and he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty  and the third captain of fifty went up  and came and fell on his knees before elijah  and besought him  and said unto him  o man of god  i pray thee  let my life  and the life of these fifty thy servants  be precious in thy sight   
   behold  there came fire down from heaven  and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties  therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight   
   and the angel of the lord said unto elijah  go down with him  be not afraid of him  and he arose  and went down with him unto the king   
   and he said unto him  thus saith the lord  forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron   is it  not because  there is  no god in israel to enquire of his word  therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up  but shalt surely die   
   so he died according to the word of the lord which elijah had spoken  and jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah  because he had no son   
   now the rest of the acts of ahaziah which he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
  kings   
   and it came to pass  when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind  that elijah went with elisha from gilgal   
  and elijah said unto elisha  tarry here  i pray thee  for the lord hath sent me to bethel  and elisha said  unto him  as  the lord liveth  and  as  thy soul liveth  i will not leave thee  so they went down to bethel   
  and the sons of the prophets that  were  at bethel came forth to elisha  and said unto him  knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day  and he said  yea  i know  it   hold ye your peace   
  and elijah said unto him  elisha  tarry here  i pray thee  for the lord hath sent me to jericho  and he said   as  the lord liveth  and  as  thy soul liveth  i will not leave thee  so they came to jericho   
  and the sons of the prophets that  were  at jericho came to elisha  and said unto him  knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day  and he answered  yea  i know  it   hold ye your peace   
  and elijah said unto him  tarry  i pray thee  here  for the lord hath sent me to jordan  and he said   as  the lord liveth  and  as  thy soul liveth  i will not leave thee  and they two went on   
  and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went  and stood to view afar off  and they two stood by jordan   
  and elijah took his mantle  and wrapped  it  together  and smote the waters  and they were divided hither and thither  so that they two went over on dry ground   
   and it came to pass  when they were gone over  that elijah said unto elisha  ask what i shall do for thee  before i be taken away from thee  and elisha said  i pray thee  let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me   
   and he said  thou hast asked a hard thing   nevertheless   if thou see me  when i am  taken from thee  it shall be so unto thee  but if not  it shall not be  so    
   and it came to pass  as they still went on  and talked  that  behold   there appeared  a chariot of fire  and horses of fire  and parted them both asunder  and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven   
   and elisha saw  it   and he cried  my father  my father  the chariot of israel  and the horsemen thereof  and he saw him no more  and he took hold of his own clothes  and rent them in two pieces   
    he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him  and went back  and stood by the bank of jordan   
   and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him  and smote the waters  and said  where  is  the lord god of elijah  and when he also had smitten the waters  they parted hither and thither  and elisha went over   
   and when the sons of the prophets which  were  to view at jericho saw him  they said  the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha  and they came to meet him  and bowed themselves to the ground before him   
   and they said unto him  behold now  there be with thy servants fifty strong men  let them go  we pray thee  and seek thy master  lest peradventure the spirit of the lord hath taken him up  and cast him upon some mountain  or into some valley  and he said  ye shall not send   
   and when they urged him till he was ashamed  he said  send  they sent therefore fifty men  and they sought three days  but found him not   
   and when they came again to him   for he tarried at jericho   he said unto them  did i not say unto you  go not   
    and the men of the city said unto elisha  behold  i pray thee  the situation of this city  is  pleasant  as my lord seeth  but the water  is  naught  and the ground barren   
   and he said  bring me a new cruse  and put salt therein  and they brought  it  to him   
   and he went forth unto the spring of the waters  and cast the salt in there  and said  thus saith the lord  i have healed these waters  there shall not be from thence any more death or barren  land    
   so the waters were healed unto this day  according to the saying of elisha which he spake   
   and he went up from thence unto bethel  and as he was going up by the way  there came forth little children out of the city  and mocked him  and said unto him  go up  thou bald head  go up  thou bald head   
   and he turned back  and looked on them  and cursed them in the name of the lord  and there came forth two she bears out of the wood  and tare forty and two children of them   
   and he went from thence to mount carmel  and from thence he returned to samaria   
  kings   
   now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah  and reigned twelve years   
  and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord  but not like his father  and like his mother  for he put away the image of baal that his father had made   
  nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat  which made israel to sin  he departed not therefrom   
  and mesha king of moab was a sheepmaster  and rendered unto the king of israel an hundred thousand lambs  and an hundred thousand rams  with the wool   
  but it came to pass  when ahab was dead  that the king of moab rebelled against the king of israel   
   and king jehoram went out of samaria the same time  and numbered all israel   
  and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah  saying  the king of moab hath rebelled against me  wilt thou go with me against moab to battle  and he said  i will go up  i  am  as thou  art   my people as thy people   and  my horses as thy horses   
  and he said  which way shall we go up  and he answered  the way through the wilderness of edom   
  so the king of israel went  and the king of judah  and the king of edom  and they fetched a compass of seven days  journey  and there was no water for the host  and for the cattle that followed them   
   and the king of israel said  alas  that the lord hath called these three kings together  to deliver them into the hand of moab   
   but jehoshaphat said   is there  not here a prophet of the lord  that we may enquire of the lord by him  and one of the king of israel s servants answered and said  here  is  elisha the son of shaphat  which poured water on the hands of elijah   
   and jehoshaphat said  the word of the lord is with him  so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him   
   and elisha said unto the king of israel  what have i to do with thee  get thee to the prophets of thy father  and to the prophets of thy mother  and the king of israel said unto him  nay  for the lord hath called these three kings together  to deliver them into the hand of moab   
   and elisha said   as  the lord of hosts liveth  before whom i stand  surely  were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah  i would not look toward thee  nor see thee   
   but now bring me a minstrel  and it came to pass  when the minstrel played  that the hand of the lord came upon him   
   and he said  thus saith the lord  make this valley full of ditches   
   for thus saith the lord  ye shall not see wind  neither shall ye see rain  yet that valley shall be filled with water  that ye may drink  both ye  and your cattle  and your beasts   
   and this is  but  a light thing in the sight of the lord  he will deliver the moabites also into your hand   
   and ye shall smite every fenced city  and every choice city  and shall fell every good tree  and stop all wells of water  and mar every good piece of land with stones   
    and it came to pass in the morning  when the meat offering was offered  that  behold  there came water by the way of edom  and the country was filled with water   
   and when all the moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them  they gathered all that were able to put on armour  and upward  and stood in the border   
   and they rose up early in the morning  and the sun shone upon the water  and the moabites saw the water on the other side  as  red as blood   
   and they said  this  is  blood  the kings are surely slain  and they have smitten one another  now therefore  moab  to the spoil   
   and when they came to the camp of israel  the israelites rose up and smote the moabites  so that they fled before them  but they went forward smiting the moabites  even in  their  country   
   and they beat down the cities  and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone  and filled it  and they stopped all the wells of water  and felled all the good trees  only in kirharaseth left they the stones thereof  howbeit the slingers went about  it   and smote it   
   and when the king of moab saw that the battle was too sore for him  he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords  to break through  even  unto the king of edom  but they could not   
   then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead  and offered him  for  a burnt offering upon the wall  and there was great indignation against israel  and they departed from him  and returned to  their own  land   
  kings   
   now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha  saying  thy servant my husband is dead  and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord  and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen   
  and elisha said unto her  what shall i do for thee  tell me  what hast thou in the house  and she said  thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house  save a pot of oil   
  then he said  go  borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours   even  empty vessels  borrow not a few   
  and when thou art come in  thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons  and shalt pour out into all those vessels  and thou shalt set aside that which is full   
  so she went from him  and shut the door upon her and upon her sons  who brought  the vessels  to her  and she poured out   
  and it came to pass  when the vessels were full  that she said unto her son  bring me yet a vessel  and he said unto her   there is  not a vessel more  and the oil stayed   
  then she came and told the man of god  and he said  go  sell the oil  and pay thy debt  and live thou and thy children of the rest   
   and it fell on a day  that elisha passed to shunem  where  was  a great woman  and she constrained him to eat bread  and  so  it was   that  as oft as he passed by  he turned in thither to eat bread   
  and she said unto her husband  behold now  i perceive that this  is  an holy man of god  which passeth by us continually   
   let us make a little chamber  i pray thee  on the wall  and let us set for him there a bed  and a table  and a stool  and a candlestick  and it shall be  when he cometh to us  that he shall turn in thither   
   and it fell on a day  that he came thither  and he turned into the chamber  and lay there   
   and he said to gehazi his servant  call this shunammite  and when he had called her  she stood before him   
   and he said unto him  say now unto her  behold  thou hast been careful for us with all this care  what  is  to be done for thee  wouldest thou be spoken for to the king  or to the captain of the host  and she answered  i dwell among mine own people   
   and he said  what then  is  to be done for her  and gehazi answered  verily she hath no child  and her husband is old   
   and he said  call her  and when he had called her  she stood in the door   
   and he said  about this season  according to the time of life  thou shalt embrace a son  and she said  nay  my lord   thou  man of god  do not lie unto thine handmaid   
   and the woman conceived  and bare a son at that season that elisha had said unto her  according to the time of life   
    and when the child was grown  it fell on a day  that he went out to his father to the reapers   
   and he said unto his father  my head  my head  and he said to a lad  carry him to his mother   
   and when he had taken him  and brought him to his mother  he sat on her knees till noon  and  then  died   
   and she went up  and laid him on the bed of the man of god  and shut  the door  upon him  and went out   
   and she called unto her husband  and said  send me  i pray thee  one of the young men  and one of the asses  that i may run to the man of god  and come again   
   and he said  wherefore wilt thou go to him to day   it is  neither new moon  nor sabbath  and she said   it shall be  well   
   then she saddled an ass  and said to her servant  drive  and go forward  slack not  thy  riding for me  except i bid thee   
   so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel  and it came to pass  when the man of god saw her afar off  that he said to gehazi his servant  behold   yonder is  that shunammite   
   run now  i pray thee  to meet her  and say unto her   is it  well with thee   is it  well with thy husband   is it  well with the child  and she answered   it is  well   
   and when she came to the man of god to the hill  she caught him by the feet  but gehazi came near to thrust her away  and the man of god said  let her alone  for her soul  is  vexed within her  and the lord hath hid  it  from me  and hath not told me   
   then she said  did i desire a son of my lord  did i not say  do not deceive me   
   then he said to gehazi  gird up thy loins  and take my staff in thine hand  and go thy way  if thou meet any man  salute him not  and if any salute thee  answer him not again  and lay my staff upon the face of the child   
   and the mother of the child said   as  the lord liveth  and  as  thy soul liveth  i will not leave thee  and he arose  and followed her   
   and gehazi passed on before them  and laid the staff upon the face of the child  but  there was  neither voice  nor hearing  wherefore he went again to meet him  and told him  saying  the child is not awaked   
   and when elisha was come into the house  behold  the child was dead   and  laid upon his bed   
   he went in therefore  and shut the door upon them twain  and prayed unto the lord   
   and he went up  and lay upon the child  and put his mouth upon his mouth  and his eyes upon his eyes  and his hands upon his hands  and he stretched himself upon the child  and the flesh of the child waxed warm   
   then he returned  and walked in the house to and fro  and went up  and stretched himself upon him  and the child sneezed seven times  and the child opened his eyes   
   and he called gehazi  and said  call this shunammite  so he called her  and when she was come in unto him  he said  take up thy son   
   then she went in  and fell at his feet  and bowed herself to the ground  and took up her son  and went out   
    and elisha came again to gilgal  and  there was  a dearth in the land  and the sons of the prophets  were  sitting before him  and he said unto his servant  set on the great pot  and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets   
   and one went out into the field to gather herbs  and found a wild vine  and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full  and came and shred  them  into the pot of pottage  for they knew  them  not   
   so they poured out for the men to eat  and it came to pass  as they were eating of the pottage  that they cried out  and said  o  thou  man of god   there is  death in the pot  and they could not eat  thereof    
   but he said  then bring meal  and he cast  it  into the pot  and he said  pour out for the people  that they may eat  and there was no harm in the pot   
   and there came a man from baalshalisha  and brought the man of god bread of the firstfruits  twenty loaves of barley  and full ears of corn in the husk thereof  and he said  give unto the people  that they may eat   
   and his servitor said  what  should i set this before an hundred men  he said again  give the people  that they may eat  for thus saith the lord  they shall eat  and shall leave  thereof    
   so he set  it  before them  and they did eat  and left  thereof   according to the word of the lord   
  kings   
   now naaman  captain of the host of the king of syria  was a great man with his master  and honourable  because by him the lord had given deliverance unto syria  he was also a mighty man in valour   but he was  a leper   
  and the syrians had gone out by companies  and had brought away captive out of the land of israel a little maid  and she waited on naaman s wife   
  and she said unto her mistress  would god my lord  were  with the prophet that  is  in samaria  for he would recover him of his leprosy   
  and  one  went in  and told his lord  saying  thus and thus said the maid that  is  of the land of israel   
  and the king of syria said  go to  go  and i will send a letter unto the king of israel  and he departed  and took with him ten talents of silver  and six thousand  pieces  of gold  and ten changes of raiment   
  and he brought the letter to the king of israel  saying  now when this letter is come unto thee  behold  i have  therewith  sent naaman my servant to thee  that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy   
  and it came to pass  when the king of israel had read the letter  that he rent his clothes  and said   am  i god  to kill and to make alive  that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy  wherefore consider  i pray you  and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me   
  and it was  so   when elisha the man of god had heard that the king of israel had rent his clothes  that he sent to the king  saying  wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes  let him come now to me  and he shall know that there is a prophet in israel   
   so naaman came with his horses and with his chariot  and stood at the door of the house of elisha   
   and elisha sent a messenger unto him  saying  go and wash in jordan seven times  and thy flesh shall come again to thee  and thou shalt be clean   
   but naaman was wroth  and went away  and said  behold  i thought  he will surely come out to me  and stand  and call on the name of the lord his god  and strike his hand over the place  and recover the leper   
    are  not abana and pharpar  rivers of damascus  better than all the waters of israel  may i not wash in them  and be clean  so he turned and went away in a rage   
   and his servants came near  and spake unto him  and said  my father   if  the prophet had bid thee  do some  great thing  wouldest thou not have done  it   how much rather then  when he saith to thee  wash  and be clean   
   then went he down  and dipped himself seven times in jordan  according to the saying of the man of god  and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child  and he was clean   
    and he returned to the man of god  he and all his company  and came  and stood before him  and he said  behold  now i know that  there is  no god in all the earth  but in israel  now therefore  i pray thee  take a blessing of thy servant   
   but he said   as  the lord liveth  before whom i stand  i will receive none  and he urged him to take  it   but he refused   
   and naaman said  shall there not then  i pray thee  be given to thy servant two mules  burden of earth  for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods  but unto the lord   
   in this thing the lord pardon thy servant   that  when my master goeth into the house of rimmon to worship there  and he leaneth on my hand  and i bow myself in the house of rimmon  when i bow down myself in the house of rimmon  the lord pardon thy servant in this thing   
   and he said unto him  go in peace  so he departed from him a little way   
    but gehazi  the servant of elisha the man of god  said  behold  my master hath spared naaman this syrian  in not receiving at his hands that which he brought  but   as  the lord liveth  i will run after him  and take somewhat of him   
   so gehazi followed after naaman  and when naaman saw  him  running after him  he lighted down from the chariot to meet him  and said   is  all well   
   and he said  all  is  well  my master hath sent me  saying  behold  even now there be come to me from mount ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets  give them  i pray thee  a talent of silver  and two changes of garments   
   and naaman said  be content  take two talents  and he urged him  and bound two talents of silver in two bags  with two changes of garments  and laid  them  upon two of his servants  and they bare  them  before him   
   and when he came to the tower  he took  them  from their hand  and bestowed  them  in the house  and he let the men go  and they departed   
   but he went in  and stood before his master  and elisha said unto him  whence  comest thou   gehazi  and he said  thy servant went no whither   
   and he said unto him  went not mine heart  with thee   when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee   is it  a time to receive money  and to receive garments  and oliveyards  and vineyards  and sheep  and oxen  and menservants  and maidservants   
   the leprosy therefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee  and unto thy seed for ever  and he went out from his presence a leper  as white  as snow   
  kings   
   and the sons of the prophets said unto elisha  behold now  the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us   
  let us go  we pray thee  unto jordan  and take thence every man a beam  and let us make us a place there  where we may dwell  and he answered  go ye   
  and one said  be content  i pray thee  and go with thy servants  and he answered  i will go   
  so he went with them  and when they came to jordan  they cut down wood   
  but as one was felling a beam  the axe head fell into the water  and he cried  and said  alas  master  for it was borrowed   
  and the man of god said  where fell it  and he shewed him the place  and he cut down a stick  and cast  it  in thither  and the iron did swim   
  therefore said he  take  it  up to thee  and he put out his hand  and took it   
   then the king of syria warred against israel  and took counsel with his servants  saying  in such and such a place  shall be  my camp   
  and the man of god sent unto the king of israel  saying  beware that thou pass not such a place  for thither the syrians are come down   
   and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god told him and warned him of  and saved himself there  not once nor twice   
   therefore the heart of the king of syria was sore troubled for this thing  and he called his servants  and said unto them  will ye not shew me which of us  is  for the king of israel   
   and one of his servants said  none  my lord  o king  but elisha  the prophet that  is  in israel  telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber   
    and he said  go and spy where he  is   that i may send and fetch him  and it was told him  saying  behold   he is  in dothan   
   therefore sent he thither horses  and chariots  and a great host  and they came by night  and compassed the city about   
   and when the servant of the man of god was risen early  and gone forth  behold  an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots  and his servant said unto him  alas  my master  how shall we do   
   and he answered  fear not  for they that  be  with us  are  more than they that  be  with them   
   and elisha prayed  and said  lord  i pray thee  open his eyes  that he may see  and the lord opened the eyes of the young man  and he saw  and  behold  the mountain  was  full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha   
   and when they came down to him  elisha prayed unto the lord  and said  smite this people  i pray thee  with blindness  and he smote them with blindness according to the word of elisha   
   and elisha said unto them  this  is  not the way  neither  is  this the city  follow me  and i will bring you to the man whom ye seek  but he led them to samaria   
   and it came to pass  when they were come into samaria  that elisha said  lord  open the eyes of these  men   that they may see  and the lord opened their eyes  and they saw  and  behold   they were  in the midst of samaria   
   and the king of israel said unto elisha  when he saw them  my father  shall i smite  them   shall i smite  them    
   and he answered  thou shalt not smite  them   wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow  set bread and water before them  that they may eat and drink  and go to their master   
   and he prepared great provision for them  and when they had eaten and drunk  he sent them away  and they went to their master  so the bands of syria came no more into the land of israel   
    and it came to pass after this  that benhadad king of syria gathered all his host  and went up  and besieged samaria   
   and there was a great famine in samaria  and  behold  they besieged it  until an ass s head was  sold  for fourscore  pieces  of silver  and the fourth part of a cab of dove s dung for five  pieces  of silver   
   and as the king of israel was passing by upon the wall  there cried a woman unto him  saying  help  my lord  o king   
   and he said  if the lord do not help thee  whence shall i help thee  out of the barnfloor  or out of the winepress   
   and the king said unto her  what aileth thee  and she answered  this woman said unto me  give thy son  that we may eat him to day  and we will eat my son to morrow   
   so we boiled my son  and did eat him  and i said unto her on the next day  give thy son  that we may eat him  and she hath hid her son   
   and it came to pass  when the king heard the words of the woman  that he rent his clothes  and he passed by upon the wall  and the people looked  and  behold   he had  sackcloth within upon his flesh   
   then he said  god do so and more also to me  if the head of elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him this day   
   but elisha sat in his house  and the elders sat with him  and  the king  sent a man from before him  but ere the messenger came to him  he said to the elders  see ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head  look  when the messenger cometh  shut the door  and hold him fast at the door   is  not the sound of his master s feet behind him   
   and while he yet talked with them  behold  the messenger came down unto him  and he said  behold  this evil  is  of the lord  what should i wait for the lord any longer   
  kings   
   then elisha said  hear ye the word of the lord  thus saith the lord  to morrow about this time  shall  a measure of fine flour  be sold  for a shekel  and two measures of barley for a shekel  in the gate of samaria   
  then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god  and said  behold   if  the lord would make windows in heaven  might this thing be  and he said  behold  thou shalt see  it  with thine eyes  but shalt not eat thereof   
   and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate  and they said one to another  why sit we here until we die   
  if we say  we will enter into the city  then the famine  is  in the city  and we shall die there  and if we sit still here  we die also  now therefore come  and let us fall unto the host of the syrians  if they save us alive  we shall live  and if they kill us  we shall but die   
  and they rose up in the twilight  to go unto the camp of the syrians  and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of syria  behold   there was  no man there   
  for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of chariots  and a noise of horses   even  the noise of a great host  and they said one to another  lo  the king of israel hath hired against us the kings of the hittites  and the kings of the egyptians  to come upon us   
  wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight  and left their tents  and their horses  and their asses  even the camp as it  was   and fled for their life   
  and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp  they went into one tent  and did eat and drink  and carried thence silver  and gold  and raiment  and went and hid  it   and came again  and entered into another tent  and carried thence  also   and went and hid  it    
  then they said one to another  we do not well  this day  is  a day of good tidings  and we hold our peace  if we tarry till the morning light  some mischief will come upon us  now therefore come  that we may go and tell the king s household   
   so they came and called unto the porter of the city  and they told them  saying  we came to the camp of the syrians  and  behold   there was  no man there  neither voice of man  but horses tied  and asses tied  and the tents as they  were    
   and he called the porters  and they told  it  to the king s house within   
    and the king arose in the night  and said unto his servants  i will now shew you what the syrians have done to us  they know that we  be  hungry  therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field  saying  when they come out of the city  we shall catch them alive  and get into the city   
   and one of his servants answered and said  let  some  take  i pray thee  five of the horses that remain  which are left in the city   behold  they  are  as all the multitude of israel that are left in it  behold   i say   they  are  even as all the multitude of the israelites that are consumed   and let us send and see   
   they took therefore two chariot horses  and the king sent after the host of the syrians  saying  go and see   
   and they went after them unto jordan  and  lo  all the way  was  full of garments and vessels  which the syrians had cast away in their haste  and the messengers returned  and told the king   
   and the people went out  and spoiled the tents of the syrians  so a measure of fine flour was  sold  for a shekel  and two measures of barley for a shekel  according to the word of the lord   
   and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate  and the people trode upon him in the gate  and he died  as the man of god had said  who spake when the king came down to him   
   and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the king  saying  two measures of barley for a shekel  and a measure of fine flour for a shekel  shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of samaria   
   and that lord answered the man of god  and said  now  behold   if  the lord should make windows in heaven  might such a thing be  and he said  behold  thou shalt see it with thine eyes  but shalt not eat thereof   
   and so it fell out unto him  for the people trode upon him in the gate  and he died   
  kings   
   then spake elisha unto the woman  whose son he had restored to life  saying  arise  and go thou and thine household  and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn  for the lord hath called for a famine  and it shall also come upon the land seven years   
  and the woman arose  and did after the saying of the man of god  and she went with her household  and sojourned in the land of the philistines seven years   
  and it came to pass at the seven years  end  that the woman returned out of the land of the philistines  and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land   
  and the king talked with gehazi the servant of the man of god  saying  tell me  i pray thee  all the great things that elisha hath done   
  and it came to pass  as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life  that  behold  the woman  whose son he had restored to life  cried to the king for her house and for her land  and gehazi said  my lord  o king  this  is  the woman  and this  is  her son  whom elisha restored to life   
  and when the king asked the woman  she told him  so the king appointed unto her a certain officer  saying  restore all that  was  hers  and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land  even until now   
   and elisha came to damascus  and benhadad the king of syria was sick  and it was told him  saying  the man of god is come hither   
  and the king said unto hazael  take a present in thine hand  and go  meet the man of god  and enquire of the lord by him  saying  shall i recover of this disease   
  so hazael went to meet him  and took a present with him  even of every good thing of damascus  forty camels  burden  and came and stood before him  and said  thy son benhadad king of syria hath sent me to thee  saying  shall i recover of this disease   
   and elisha said unto him  go  say unto him  thou mayest certainly recover  howbeit the lord hath shewed me that he shall surely die   
   and he settled his countenance stedfastly  until he was ashamed  and the man of god wept   
   and hazael said  why weepeth my lord  and he answered  because i know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of israel  their strong holds wilt thou set on fire  and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword  and wilt dash their children  and rip up their women with child   
   and hazael said  but what   is  thy servant a dog  that he should do this great thing  and elisha answered  the lord hath shewed me that thou  shalt be  king over syria   
   so he departed from elisha  and came to his master  who said to him  what said elisha to thee  and he answered  he told me  that  thou shouldest surely recover   
   and it came to pass on the morrow  that he took a thick cloth  and dipped  it  in water  and spread  it  on his face  so that he died  and hazael reigned in his stead   
    and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel  jehoshaphat  being  then king of judah  jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah began to reign   
   thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign  and he reigned eight years in jerusalem   
   and he walked in the way of the kings of israel  as did the house of ahab  for the daughter of ahab was his wife  and he did evil in the sight of the lord   
   yet the lord would not destroy judah for david his servant s sake  as he promised him to give him alway a light   and  to his children   
   in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah  and made a king over themselves   
   so joram went over to zair  and all the chariots with him  and he rose by night  and smote the edomites which compassed him about  and the captains of the chariots  and the people fled into their tents   
   yet edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day  then libnah revolted at the same time   
   and the rest of the acts of joram  and all that he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
   and joram slept with his fathers  and was buried with his fathers in the city of david  and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead   
    in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel did ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah begin to reign   
   two and twenty years old  was  ahaziah when he began to reign  and he reigned one year in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  athaliah  the daughter of omri king of israel   
   and he walked in the way of the house of ahab  and did evil in the sight of the lord  as  did  the house of ahab  for he  was  the son in law of the house of ahab   
   and he went with joram the son of ahab to the war against hazael king of syria in ramothgilead  and the syrians wounded joram   
   and king joram went back to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him at ramah  when he fought against hazael king of syria  and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel  because he was sick   
  kings   
   and elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets  and said unto him  gird up thy loins  and take this box of oil in thine hand  and go to ramothgilead   
  and when thou comest thither  look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi  and go in  and make him arise up from among his brethren  and carry him to an inner chamber   
  then take the box of oil  and pour  it  on his head  and say  thus saith the lord  i have anointed thee king over israel  then open the door  and flee  and tarry not   
  so the young man   even  the young man the prophet  went to ramothgilead   
  and when he came  behold  the captains of the host  were  sitting  and he said  i have an errand to thee  o captain  and jehu said  unto which of all us  and he said  to thee  o captain   
  and he arose  and went into the house  and he poured the oil on his head  and said unto him  thus saith the lord god of israel  i have anointed thee king over the people of the lord   even  over israel   
  and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master  that i may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets  and the blood of all the servants of the lord  at the hand of jezebel   
  for the whole house of ahab shall perish  and i will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall  and him that is shut up and left in israel   
  and i will make the house of ahab like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat  and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah   
   and the dogs shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel  and  there shall be  none to bury  her   and he opened the door  and fled   
    then jehu came forth to the servants of his lord  and  one  said unto him   is  all well  wherefore came this mad  fellow  to thee  and he said unto them  ye know the man  and his communication   
   and they said   it is  false  tell us now  and he said  thus and thus spake he to me  saying  thus saith the lord  i have anointed thee king over israel   
   then they hasted  and took every man his garment  and put  it  under him on the top of the stairs  and blew with trumpets  saying  jehu is king   
   so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired against joram   now joram had kept ramothgilead  he and all israel  because of hazael king of syria   
   but king joram was returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him  when he fought with hazael king of syria   and jehu said  if it be your minds   then  let none go forth  nor  escape out of the city to go to tell  it  in jezreel   
    so jehu rode in a chariot  and went to jezreel  for joram lay there  and ahaziah king of judah was come down to see joram   
   and there stood a watchman on the tower in jezreel  and he spied the company of jehu as he came  and said  i see a company  and joram said  take an horseman  and send to meet them  and let him say   is it  peace   
   so there went one on horseback to meet him  and said  thus saith the king   is it  peace  and jehu said  what hast thou to do with peace  turn thee behind me  and the watchman told  saying  the messenger came to them  but he cometh not again   
   then he sent out a second on horseback  which came to them  and said  thus saith the king   is it  peace  and jehu answered  what hast thou to do with peace  turn thee behind me   
   and the watchman told  saying  he came even unto them  and cometh not again  and the driving  is  like the driving of jehu the son of nimshi  for he driveth furiously   
   and joram said  make ready  and his chariot was made ready  and joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out  each in his chariot  and they went out against jehu  and met him in the portion of naboth the jezreelite   
   and it came to pass  when joram saw jehu  that he said   is it  peace  jehu  and he answered  what peace  so long as the whoredoms of thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts  are so  many   
   and joram turned his hands  and fled  and said to ahaziah   there is  treachery  o ahaziah   
   and jehu drew a bow with his full strength  and smote jehoram between his arms  and the arrow went out at his heart  and he sunk down in his chariot   
   then said  jehu  to bidkar his captain  take up   and  cast him in the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite  for remember how that  when i and thou rode together after ahab his father  the lord laid this burden upon him   
   surely i have seen yesterday the blood of naboth  and the blood of his sons  saith the lord  and i will requite thee in this plat  saith the lord  now therefore take  and  cast him into the plat  of ground   according to the word of the lord   
   but when ahaziah the king of judah saw  this   he fled by the way of the garden house  and jehu followed after him  and said  smite him also in the chariot   and they did so  at the going up to gur  which  is  by ibleam  and he fled to megiddo  and died there   
   and his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem  and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of david   
   and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziah to reign over judah   
    and when jehu was come to jezreel  jezebel heard  of it   and she painted her face  and tired her head  and looked out at a window   
   and as jehu entered in at the gate  she said   had  zimri peace  who slew his master   
   and he lifted up his face to the window  and said  who  is  on my side  who  and there looked out to him two  or  three eunuchs   
   and he said  throw her down  so they threw her down  and  some  of her blood was sprinkled on the wall  and on the horses  and he trode her under foot   
   and when he was come in  he did eat and drink  and said  go  see now this cursed  woman   and bury her  for she  is  a king s daughter   
   and they went to bury her  but they found no more of her than the skull  and the feet  and the palms of  her  hands   
   wherefore they came again  and told him  and he said  this  is  the word of the lord  which he spake by his servant elijah the tishbite  saying  in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel   
   and the carcase of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of jezreel   so  that they shall not say  this  is  jezebel   
  kings    
   and ahab had seventy sons in samaria  and jehu wrote letters  and sent to samaria  unto the rulers of jezreel  to the elders  and to them that brought up ahab s  children   saying   
  now as soon as this letter cometh to you  seeing your master s sons  are  with you  and  there are  with you chariots and horses  a fenced city also  and armour   
  look even out the best and meetest of your master s sons  and set  him  on his father s throne  and fight for your master s house   
  but they were exceedingly afraid  and said  behold  two kings stood not before him  how then shall we stand   
  and he that  was  over the house  and he that  was  over the city  the elders also  and the bringers up  of the children   sent to jehu  saying  we  are  thy servants  and will do all that thou shalt bid us  we will not make any king  do thou  that which is  good in thine eyes   
  then he wrote a letter the second time to them  saying  if ye  be  mine  and  if  ye will hearken unto my voice  take ye the heads of the men your master s sons  and come to me to jezreel by to morrow this time  now the king s sons   being  seventy persons   were  with the great men of the city  which brought them up   
  and it came to pass  when the letter came to them  that they took the king s sons  and slew seventy persons  and put their heads in baskets  and sent him  them  to jezreel   
  and there came a messenger  and told him  saying  they have brought the heads of the king s sons  and he said  lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning   
  and it came to pass in the morning  that he went out  and stood  and said to all the people  ye  be  righteous  behold  i conspired against my master  and slew him  but who slew all these   
   know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the lord  which the lord spake concerning the house of ahab  for the lord hath done  that  which he spake by his servant elijah   
   so jehu slew all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreel  and all his great men  and his kinsfolks  and his priests  until he left him none remaining   
   and he arose and departed  and came to samaria   and  as he  was  at the shearing house in the way   
   jehu met with the brethren of ahaziah king of judah  and said  who  are  ye  and they answered  we  are  the brethren of ahaziah  and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen   
   and he said  take them alive  and they took them alive  and slew them at the pit of the shearing house   even  two and forty men  neither left he any of them   
    and when he was departed thence  he lighted on jehonadab the son of rechab  coming  to meet him  and he saluted him  and said to him  is thine heart right  as my heart  is  with thy heart  and jehonadab answered  it is  if it be  give  me  thine hand  and he gave  him  his hand  and he took him up to him into the chariot   
   and he said  come with me  and see my zeal for the lord  so they made him ride in his chariot   
   and when he came to samaria  he slew all that remained unto ahab in samaria  till he had destroyed him  according to the saying of the lord  which he spake to elijah   
   and jehu gathered all the people together  and said unto them  ahab served baal a little   but  jehu shall serve him much   
   now therefore call unto me all the prophets of baal  all his servants  and all his priests  let none be wanting  for i have a great sacrifice  to do  to baal  whosoever shall be wanting  he shall not live  but jehu did  it  in subtilty  to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of baal   
   and jehu said  proclaim a solemn assembly for baal  and they proclaimed  it    
   and jehu sent through all israel  and all the worshippers of baal came  so that there was not a man left that came not  and they came into the house of baal  and the house of baal was full from one end to another   
   and he said unto him that  was  over the vestry  bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of baal  and he brought them forth vestments   
   and jehu went  and jehonadab the son of rechab  into the house of baal  and said unto the worshippers of baal  search  and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the lord  but the worshippers of baal only   
   and when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings  jehu appointed fourscore men without  and said   if  any of the men whom i have brought into your hands escape   he that letteth him go   his life  shall be  for the life of him   
   and it came to pass  as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering  that jehu said to the guard and to the captains  go in   and  slay them  let none come forth  and they smote them with the edge of the sword  and the guard and the captains cast  them  out  and went to the city of the house of baal   
   and they brought forth the images out of the house of baal  and burned them   
   and they brake down the image of baal  and brake down the house of baal  and made it a draught house unto this day   
   thus jehu destroyed baal out of israel   
    howbeit  from  the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat  who made israel to sin  jehu departed not from after them   to wit   the golden calves that  were  in bethel  and that  were  in dan   
   and the lord said unto jehu  because thou hast done well in executing  that which is  right in mine eyes   and  hast done unto the house of ahab according to all that  was  in mine heart  thy children of the fourth  generation  shall sit on the throne of israel   
   but jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the lord god of israel with all his heart  for he departed not from the sins of jeroboam  which made israel to sin   
   in those days the lord began to cut israel short  and hazael smote them in all the coasts of israel   
   from jordan eastward  all the land of gilead  the gadites  and the reubenites  and the manassites  from aroer  which  is  by the river arnon  even gilead and bashan   
   now the rest of the acts of jehu  and all that he did  and all his might   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   and jehu slept with his fathers  and they buried him in samaria  and jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead   
   and the time that jehu reigned over israel in samaria  was  twenty and eight years   
  kings    
   and when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead  she arose and destroyed all the seed royal   
  but jehosheba  the daughter of king joram  sister of ahaziah  took joash the son of ahaziah  and stole him from among the king s sons  which were  slain  and they hid him   even  him and his nurse  in the bedchamber from athaliah  so that he was not slain   
  and he was with her hid in the house of the lord six years  and athaliah did reign over the land   
   and the seventh year jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds  with the captains and the guard  and brought them to him into the house of the lord  and made a covenant with them  and took an oath of them in the house of the lord  and shewed them the king s son   
  and he commanded them  saying  this  is  the thing that ye shall do  a third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king s house   
  and a third part  shall be  at the gate of sur  and a third part at the gate behind the guard  so shall ye keep the watch of the house  that it be not broken down   
  and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath  even they shall keep the watch of the house of the lord about the king   
  and ye shall compass the king round about  every man with his weapons in his hand  and he that cometh within the ranges  let him be slain  and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in   
  and the captains over the hundreds did according to all  things  that jehoiada the priest commanded  and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath  with them that should go out on the sabbath  and came to jehoiada the priest   
   and to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king david s spears and shields  that  were  in the temple of the lord   
   and the guard stood  every man with his weapons in his hand  round about the king  from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple   along  by the altar and the temple   
   and he brought forth the king s son  and put the crown upon him  and  gave him  the testimony  and they made him king  and anointed him  and they clapped their hands  and said  god save the king   
    and when athaliah heard the noise of the guard  and  of the people  she came to the people into the temple of the lord   
   and when she looked  behold  the king stood by a pillar  as the manner  was   and the princes and the trumpeters by the king  and all the people of the land rejoiced  and blew with trumpets  and athaliah rent her clothes  and cried  treason  treason   
   but jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds  the officers of the host  and said unto them  have her forth without the ranges  and him that followeth her kill with the sword  for the priest had said  let her not be slain in the house of the lord   
   and they laid hands on her  and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king s house  and there was she slain   
    and jehoiada made a covenant between the lord and the king and the people  that they should be the lord s people  between the king also and the people   
   and all the people of the land went into the house of baal  and brake it down  his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly  and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars  and the priest appointed officers over the house of the lord   
   and he took the rulers over hundreds  and the captains  and the guard  and all the people of the land  and they brought down the king from the house of the lord  and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king s house  and he sat on the throne of the kings   
   and all the people of the land rejoiced  and the city was in quiet  and they slew athaliah with the sword  beside  the king s house   
   seven years old  was  jehoash when he began to reign   
  kings    
   in the seventh year of jehu jehoash began to reign  and forty years reigned he in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  zibiah of beersheba   
  and jehoash did  that which was  right in the sight of the lord all his days wherein jehoiada the priest instructed him   
  but the high places were not taken away  the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places   
   and jehoash said to the priests  all the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the lord   even  the money of every one that passeth  the account   the money that every man is set at   and  all the money that cometh into any man s heart to bring into the house of the lord   
  let the priests take  it  to them  every man of his acquaintance  and let them repair the breaches of the house  wheresoever any breach shall be found   
  but it was  so  that  in the three and twentieth year of king jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house   
  then king jehoash called for jehoiada the priest  and the  other  priests  and said unto them  why repair ye not the breaches of the house  now therefore receive no  more  money of your acquaintance  but deliver it for the breaches of the house   
  and the priests consented to receive no  more  money of the people  neither to repair the breaches of the house   
  but jehoiada the priest took a chest  and bored a hole in the lid of it  and set it beside the altar  on the right side as one cometh into the house of the lord  and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money  that was  brought into the house of the lord   
   and it was  so   when they saw that  there was  much money in the chest  that the king s scribe and the high priest came up  and they put up in bags  and told the money that was found in the house of the lord   
   and they gave the money  being told  into the hands of them that did the work  that had the oversight of the house of the lord  and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders  that wrought upon the house of the lord   
   and to masons  and hewers of stone  and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the lord  and for all that was laid out for the house to repair  it    
   howbeit there were not made for the house of the lord bowls of silver  snuffers  basons  trumpets  any vessels of gold  or vessels of silver  of the money  that was  brought into the house of the lord   
   but they gave that to the workmen  and repaired therewith the house of the lord   
   moreover they reckoned not with the men  into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen  for they dealt faithfully   
   the trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the lord  it was the priests    
    then hazael king of syria went up  and fought against gath  and took it  and hazael set his face to go up to jerusalem   
   and jehoash king of judah took all the hallowed things that jehoshaphat  and jehoram  and ahaziah  his fathers  kings of judah  had dedicated  and his own hallowed things  and all the gold  that was  found in the treasures of the house of the lord  and in the king s house  and sent  it  to hazael king of syria  and he went away from jerusalem   
   and the rest of the acts of joash  and all that he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
   and his servants arose  and made a conspiracy  and slew joash in the house of millo  which goeth down to silla   
   for jozachar the son of shimeath  and jehozabad the son of shomer  his servants  smote him  and he died  and they buried him with his fathers in the city of david  and amaziah his son reigned in his stead   
  kings    
   in the three and twentieth year of joash the son of ahaziah king of judah jehoahaz the son of jehu began to reign over israel in samaria   and reigned  seventeen years   
  and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  and followed the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat  which made israel to sin  he departed not therefrom   
  and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel  and he delivered them into the hand of hazael king of syria  and into the hand of benhadad the son of hazael  all  their  days   
  and jehoahaz besought the lord  and the lord hearkened unto him  for he saw the oppression of israel  because the king of syria oppressed them   
   and the lord gave israel a saviour  so that they went out from under the hand of the syrians  and the children of israel dwelt in their tents  as beforetime   
  nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of jeroboam  who made israel sin   but  walked therein  and there remained the grove also in samaria    
  neither did he leave of the people to jehoahaz but fifty horsemen  and ten chariots  and ten thousand footmen  for the king of syria had destroyed them  and had made them like the dust by threshing   
  now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz  and all that he did  and his might   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
  and jehoahaz slept with his fathers  and they buried him in samaria  and joash his son reigned in his stead   
    in the thirty and seventh year of joash king of judah began jehoash the son of jehoahaz to reign over israel in samaria   and reigned  sixteen years   
   and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat  who made israel sin   but  he walked therein   
   and the rest of the acts of joash  and all that he did  and his might wherewith he fought against amaziah king of judah   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   and joash slept with his fathers  and jeroboam sat upon his throne  and joash was buried in samaria with the kings of israel   
   now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died  and joash the king of israel came down unto him  and wept over his face  and said  o my father  my father  the chariot of israel  and the horsemen thereof   
   and elisha said unto him  take bow and arrows  and he took unto him bow and arrows   
   and he said to the king of israel  put thine hand upon the bow  and he put his hand  upon it   and elisha put his hands upon the king s hands   
   and he said  open the window eastward  and he opened  it   then elisha said  shoot  and he shot  and he said  the arrow of the lord s deliverance  and the arrow of deliverance from syria  for thou shalt smite the syrians in aphek  till thou have consumed  them    
   and he said  take the arrows  and he took  them   and he said unto the king of israel  smite upon the ground  and he smote thrice  and stayed   
   and the man of god was wroth with him  and said  thou shouldest have smitten five or six times  then hadst thou smitten syria till thou hadst consumed  it   whereas now thou shalt smite syria  but  thrice   
    and elisha died  and they buried him  and the bands of the moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year   
   and it came to pass  as they were burying a man  that  behold  they spied a band  of men   and they cast the man into the sepulchre of elisha  and when the man was let down  and touched the bones of elisha  he revived  and stood up on his feet   
   but hazael king of syria oppressed israel all the days of jehoahaz   
   and the lord was gracious unto them  and had compassion on them  and had respect unto them  because of his covenant with abraham  isaac  and jacob  and would not destroy them  neither cast he them from his presence as yet   
   so hazael king of syria died  and benhadad his son reigned in his stead   
   and jehoash the son of jehoahaz took again out of the hand of benhadad the son of hazael the cities  which he had taken out of the hand of jehoahaz his father by war  three times did joash beat him  and recovered the cities of israel   
  kings    
   in the second year of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel reigned amaziah the son of joash king of judah   
  he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign  and reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  jehoaddan of jerusalem   
  and he did  that which was  right in the sight of the lord  yet not like david his father  he did according to all things as joash his father did   
  howbeit the high places were not taken away  as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places   
  and it came to pass  as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand  that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father   
  but the children of the murderers he slew not  according unto that which is written in the book of the law of moses  wherein the lord commanded  saying  the fathers shall not be put to death for the children  nor the children be put to death for the fathers  but every man shall be put to death for his own sin   
  he slew of edom in the valley of salt ten thousand  and took selah by war  and called the name of it joktheel unto this day   
   then amaziah sent messengers to jehoash  the son of jehoahaz son of jehu  king of israel  saying  come  let us look one another in the face   
  and jehoash the king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah  saying  the thistle that  was  in lebanon sent to the cedar that  was  in lebanon  saying  give thy daughter to my son to wife  and there passed by a wild beast that  was  in lebanon  and trode down the thistle   
   thou hast indeed smitten edom  and thine heart hath lifted thee up  glory  of this   and tarry at home  for why shouldest thou meddle to  thy  hurt  that thou shouldest fall   even  thou  and judah with thee   
   but amaziah would not hear  therefore jehoash king of israel went up  and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the face at bethshemesh  which  belongeth  to judah   
   and judah was put to the worse before israel  and they fled every man to their tents   
   and jehoash king of israel took amaziah king of judah  the son of jehoash the son of ahaziah  at bethshemesh  and came to jerusalem  and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim unto the corner gate  four hundred cubits   
   and he took all the gold and silver  and all the vessels that were found in the house of the lord  and in the treasures of the king s house  and hostages  and returned to samaria   
    now the rest of the acts of jehoash which he did  and his might  and how he fought with amaziah king of judah   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   and jehoash slept with his fathers  and was buried in samaria with the kings of israel  and jeroboam his son reigned in his stead   
   and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years   
   and the rest of the acts of amaziah   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
   now they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem  and he fled to lachish  but they sent after him to lachish  and slew him there   
   and they brought him on horses  and he was buried at jerusalem with his fathers in the city of david   
   and all the people of judah took azariah  which  was  sixteen years old  and made him king instead of his father amaziah   
   he built elath  and restored it to judah  after that the king slept with his fathers   
    in the fifteenth year of amaziah the son of joash king of judah jeroboam the son of joash king of israel began to reign in samaria   and reigned  forty and one years   
   and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat  who made israel to sin   
   he restored the coast of israel from the entering of hamath unto the sea of the plain  according to the word of the lord god of israel  which he spake by the hand of his servant jonah  the son of amittai  the prophet  which  was  of gathhepher   
   for the lord saw the affliction of israel   that it was  very bitter  for  there was  not any shut up  nor any left  nor any helper for israel   
   and the lord said not that he would blot out the name of israel from under heaven  but he saved them by the hand of jeroboam the son of joash   
   now the rest of the acts of jeroboam  and all that he did  and his might  how he warred  and how he recovered damascus  and hamath   which belonged  to judah  for israel  are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   and jeroboam slept with his fathers   even  with the kings of israel  and zachariah his son reigned in his stead   
  kings    
   in the twenty and seventh year of jeroboam king of israel began azariah son of amaziah king of judah to reign   
  sixteen years old was he when he began to reign  and he reigned two and fifty years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  jecholiah of jerusalem   
  and he did  that which was  right in the sight of the lord  according to all that his father amaziah had done   
  save that the high places were not removed  the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places   
  and the lord smote the king  so that he was a leper unto the day of his death  and dwelt in a several house  and jotham the king s son  was  over the house  judging the people of the land   
  and the rest of the acts of azariah  and all that he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
  so azariah slept with his fathers  and they buried him with his fathers in the city of david  and jotham his son reigned in his stead   
   in the thirty and eighth year of azariah king of judah did zachariah the son of jeroboam reign over israel in samaria six months   
  and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  as his fathers had done  he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat  who made israel to sin   
   and shallum the son of jabesh conspired against him  and smote him before the people  and slew him  and reigned in his stead   
   and the rest of the acts of zachariah  behold  they  are  written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   this  was  the word of the lord which he spake unto jehu  saying  thy sons shall sit on the throne of israel unto the fourth  generation   and so it came to pass   
   shallum the son of jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of uzziah king of judah  and he reigned a full month in samaria   
   for menahem the son of gadi went up from tirzah  and came to samaria  and smote shallum the son of jabesh in samaria  and slew him  and reigned in his stead   
   and the rest of the acts of shallum  and his conspiracy which he made  behold  they  are  written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   then menahem smote tiphsah  and all that  were  therein  and the coasts thereof from tirzah  because they opened not  to him   therefore he smote  it  and  all the women therein that were with child he ripped up   
   in the nine and thirtieth year of azariah king of judah began menahem the son of gadi to reign over israel   and reigned  ten years in samaria   
   and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  he departed not all his days from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat  who made israel to sin   
    and  pul the king of assyria came against the land  and menahem gave pul a thousand talents of silver  that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand   
   and menahem exacted the money of israel   even  of all the mighty men of wealth  of each man fifty shekels of silver  to give to the king of assyria  so the king of assyria turned back  and stayed not there in the land   
   and the rest of the acts of menahem  and all that he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   and menahem slept with his fathers  and pekahiah his son reigned in his stead   
   in the fiftieth year of azariah king of judah pekahiah the son of menahem began to reign over israel in samaria   and reigned  two years   
   and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat  who made israel to sin   
   but pekah the son of remaliah  a captain of his  conspired against him  and smote him in samaria  in the palace of the king s house  with argob and arieh  and with him fifty men of the gileadites  and he killed him  and reigned in his room   
   and the rest of the acts of pekahiah  and all that he did  behold  they  are  written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
   in the two and fiftieth year of azariah king of judah pekah the son of remaliah began to reign over israel in samaria   and reigned  twenty years   
   and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat  who made israel to sin   
   in the days of pekah king of israel came tiglathpileser king of assyria  and took ijon  and abelbethmaachah  and janoah  and kedesh  and hazor  and gilead  and galilee  all the land of naphtali  and carried them captive to assyria   
   and hoshea the son of elah made a conspiracy against pekah the son of remaliah  and smote him  and slew him  and reigned in his stead  in the twentieth year of jotham the son of uzziah   
   and the rest of the acts of pekah  and all that he did  behold  they  are  written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   
    in the second year of pekah the son of remaliah king of israel began jotham the son of uzziah king of judah to reign   
   five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign  and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  jerusha  the daughter of zadok   
   and he did  that which was  right in the sight of the lord  he did according to all that his father uzziah had done   
   howbeit the high places were not removed  the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places  he built the higher gate of the house of the lord   
   now the rest of the acts of jotham  and all that he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
   in those days the lord began to send against judah rezin the king of syria  and pekah the son of remaliah   
   and jotham slept with his fathers  and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father  and ahaz his son reigned in his stead   
  kings    
   in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son of jotham king of judah began to reign   
  twenty years old  was  ahaz when he began to reign  and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem  and did not  that which was  right in the sight of the lord his god  like david his father   
  but he walked in the way of the kings of israel  yea  and made his son to pass through the fire  according to the abominations of the heathen  whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel   
  and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places  and on the hills  and under every green tree   
   then rezin king of syria and pekah son of remaliah king of israel came up to jerusalem to war  and they besieged ahaz  but could not overcome  him    
  at that time rezin king of syria recovered elath to syria  and drave the jews from elath  and the syrians came to elath  and dwelt there unto this day   
  so ahaz sent messengers to tiglathpileser king of assyria  saying  i  am  thy servant and thy son  come up  and save me out of the hand of the king of syria  and out of the hand of the king of israel  which rise up against me   
  and ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the lord  and in the treasures of the king s house  and sent  it for  a present to the king of assyria   
  and the king of assyria hearkened unto him  for the king of assyria went up against damascus  and took it  and carried  the people of  it captive to kir  and slew rezin   
    and king ahaz went to damascus to meet tiglathpileser king of assyria  and saw an altar that  was  at damascus  and king ahaz sent to urijah the priest the fashion of the altar  and the pattern of it  according to all the workmanship thereof   
   and urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king ahaz had sent from damascus  so urijah the priest made  it  against king ahaz came from damascus   
   and when the king was come from damascus  the king saw the altar  and the king approached to the altar  and offered thereon   
   and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering  and poured his drink offering  and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings  upon the altar   
   and he brought also the brasen altar  which  was  before the lord  from the forefront of the house  from between the altar and the house of the lord  and put it on the north side of the altar   
   and king ahaz commanded urijah the priest  saying  upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering  and the evening meat offering  and the king s burnt sacrifice  and his meat offering  with the burnt offering of all the people of the land  and their meat offering  and their drink offerings  and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering  and all the blood of the sacrifice  and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire  by    
   thus did urijah the priest  according to all that king ahaz commanded   
    and king ahaz cut off the borders of the bases  and removed the laver from off them  and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that  were  under it  and put it upon a pavement of stones   
   and the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house  and the king s entry without  turned he from the house of the lord for the king of assyria   
   now the rest of the acts of ahaz which he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
   and ahaz slept with his fathers  and was buried with his fathers in the city of david  and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead   
  kings    
   in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of elah to reign in samaria over israel nine years   
  and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  but not as the kings of israel that were before him   
  against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria  and hoshea became his servant  and gave him presents   
  and the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea  for he had sent messengers to so king of egypt  and brought no present to the king of assyria  as  he had done  year by year  therefore the king of assyria shut him up  and bound him in prison   
  then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land  and went up to samaria  and besieged it three years   
  in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria  and carried israel away into assyria  and placed them in halah and in habor  by  the river of gozan  and in the cities of the medes   
   for  so  it was  that the children of israel had sinned against the lord their god  which had brought them up out of the land of egypt  from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt  and had feared other gods   
  and walked in the statutes of the heathen  whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel  and of the kings of israel  which they had made   
  and the children of israel did secretly  those  things that  were  not right against the lord their god  and they built them high places in all their cities  from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city   
   and they set them up images and groves in every high hill  and under every green tree   
   and there they burnt incense in all the high places  as  did  the heathen whom the lord carried away before them  and wrought wicked things to provoke the lord to anger   
   for they served idols  whereof the lord had said unto them  ye shall not do this thing   
   yet the lord testified against israel  and against judah  by all the prophets   and by  all the seers  saying  turn ye from your evil ways  and keep my commandments  and  my statutes  according to all the law which i commanded your fathers  and which i sent to you by my servants the prophets   
   notwithstanding they would not hear  but hardened their necks  like to the neck of their fathers  that did not believe in the lord their god   
   and they rejected his statutes  and his covenant that he made with their fathers  and his testimonies which he testified against them  and they followed vanity  and became vain  and went after the heathen that  were  round about them   concerning  whom the lord had charged them  that they should not do like them   
   and they left all the commandments of the lord their god  and made them molten images   even  two calves  and made a grove  and worshipped all the host of heaven  and served baal   
   and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire  and used divination and enchantments  and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the lord  to provoke him to anger   
   therefore the lord was very angry with israel  and removed them out of his sight  there was none left but the tribe of judah only   
   also judah kept not the commandments of the lord their god  but walked in the statutes of israel which they made   
   and the lord rejected all the seed of israel  and afflicted them  and delivered them into the hand of spoilers  until he had cast them out of his sight   
   for he rent israel from the house of david  and they made jeroboam the son of nebat king  and jeroboam drave israel from following the lord  and made them sin a great sin   
   for the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam which he did  they departed not from them   
   until the lord removed israel out of his sight  as he had said by all his servants the prophets  so was israel carried away out of their own land to assyria unto this day   
    and the king of assyria brought  men  from babylon  and from cuthah  and from ava  and from hamath  and from sepharvaim  and placed  them  in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel  and they possessed samaria  and dwelt in the cities thereof   
   and  so  it was at the beginning of their dwelling there   that  they feared not the lord  therefore the lord sent lions among them  which slew  some  of them   
   wherefore they spake to the king of assyria  saying  the nations which thou hast removed  and placed in the cities of samaria  know not the manner of the god of the land  therefore he hath sent lions among them  and  behold  they slay them  because they know not the manner of the god of the land   
   then the king of assyria commanded  saying  carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence  and let them go and dwell there  and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land   
   then one of the priests whom they had carried away from samaria came and dwelt in bethel  and taught them how they should fear the lord   
   howbeit every nation made gods of their own  and put  them  in the houses of the high places which the samaritans had made  every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt   
   and the men of babylon made succothbenoth  and the men of cuth made nergal  and the men of hamath made ashima   
   and the avites made nibhaz and tartak  and the sepharvites burnt their children in fire to adrammelech and anammelech  the gods of sepharvaim   
   so they feared the lord  and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places  which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places   
   they feared the lord  and served their own gods  after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence   
   unto this day they do after the former manners  they fear not the lord  neither do they after their statutes  or after their ordinances  or after the law and commandment which the lord commanded the children of jacob  whom he named israel   
   with whom the lord had made a covenant  and charged them  saying  ye shall not fear other gods  nor bow yourselves to them  nor serve them  nor sacrifice to them   
   but the lord  who brought you up out of the land of egypt with great power and a stretched out arm  him shall ye fear  and him shall ye worship  and to him shall ye do sacrifice   
   and the statutes  and the ordinances  and the law  and the commandment  which he wrote for you  ye shall observe to do for evermore  and ye shall not fear other gods   
   and the covenant that i have made with you ye shall not forget  neither shall ye fear other gods   
   but the lord your god ye shall fear  and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies   
   howbeit they did not hearken  but they did after their former manner   
   so these nations feared the lord  and served their graven images  both their children  and their children s children  as did their fathers  so do they unto this day   
  kings    
   now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel   that  hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign   
  twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign  and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem  his mother s name also  was  abi  the daughter of zachariah   
  and he did  that which was  right in the sight of the lord  according to all that david his father did   
  he removed the high places  and brake the images  and cut down the groves  and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that moses had made  for unto those days the children of israel did burn incense to it  and he called it nehushtan   
  he trusted in the lord god of israel  so that after him was none like him among all the kings of judah  nor  any  that were before him   
  for he clave to the lord   and  departed not from following him  but kept his commandments  which the lord commanded moses   
  and the lord was with him   and  he prospered whithersoever he went forth  and he rebelled against the king of assyria  and served him not   
  he smote the philistines   even  unto gaza  and the borders thereof  from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city   
   and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah  which  was  the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel   that  shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria  and besieged it   
   and at the end of three years they took it   even  in the sixth year of hezekiah  that  is  the ninth year of hoshea king of israel  samaria was taken   
   and the king of assyria did carry away israel unto assyria  and put them in halah and in habor  by  the river of gozan  and in the cities of the medes   
   because they obeyed not the voice of the lord their god  but transgressed his covenant   and  all that moses the servant of the lord commanded  and would not hear  them   nor do  them    
   now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king of assyria come up against all the fenced cities of judah  and took them   
   and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to lachish  saying  i have offended  return from me  that which thou puttest on me will i bear  and the king of assyria appointed unto hezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold   
   and hezekiah gave  him  all the silver that was found in the house of the lord  and in the treasures of the king s house   
   at that time did hezekiah cut off  the gold from  the doors of the temple of the lord  and  from  the pillars which hezekiah king of judah had overlaid  and gave it to the king of assyria   
    and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsaris and rabshakeh from lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem  and they went up and came to jerusalem  and when they were come up  they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool  which  is  in the highway of the fuller s field   
   and when they had called to the king  there came out to them eliakim the son of hilkiah  which  was  over the household  and shebna the scribe  and joah the son of asaph the recorder   
   and rabshakeh said unto them  speak ye now to hezekiah  thus saith the great king  the king of assyria  what confidence  is  this wherein thou trustest   
   thou sayest   but  they are but  vain words    i have  counsel and strength for the war  now on whom dost thou trust  that thou rebellest against me   
   now  behold  thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed   even  upon egypt  on which if a man lean  it will go into his hand  and pierce it  so  is  pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him   
   but if ye say unto me  we trust in the lord our god   is  not that he  whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away  and hath said to judah and jerusalem  ye shall worship before this altar in jerusalem   
   now therefore  i pray thee  give pledges to my lord the king of assyria  and i will deliver thee two thousand horses  if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them   
   how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master s servants  and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen   
   am i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it  the lord said to me  go up against this land  and destroy it   
   then said eliakim the son of hilkiah  and shebna  and joah  unto rabshakeh  speak  i pray thee  to thy servants in the syrian language  for we understand  it   and talk not with us in the jews  language in the ears of the people that  are  on the wall   
   but rabshakeh said unto them  hath my master sent me to thy master  and to thee  to speak these words   hath he  not  sent me  to the men which sit on the wall  that they may eat their own dung  and drink their own piss with you   
   then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews  language  and spake  saying  hear the word of the great king  the king of assyria   
   thus saith the king  let not hezekiah deceive you  for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand   
   neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord  saying  the lord will surely deliver us  and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria   
   hearken not to hezekiah  for thus saith the king of assyria  make  an agreement  with me by a present  and come out to me  and  then  eat ye every man of his own vine  and every one of his fig tree  and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern   
   until i come and take you away to a land like your own land  a land of corn and wine  a land of bread and vineyards  a land of oil olive and of honey  that ye may live  and not die  and hearken not unto hezekiah  when he persuadeth you  saying  the lord will deliver us   
   hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of assyria   
   where  are  the gods of hamath  and of arpad  where  are  the gods of sepharvaim  hena  and ivah  have they delivered samaria out of mine hand   
   who  are  they among all the gods of the countries  that have delivered their country out of mine hand  that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of mine hand   
   but the people held their peace  and answered him not a word  for the king s commandment was  saying  answer him not   
   then came eliakim the son of hilkiah  which  was  over the household  and shebna the scribe  and joah the son of asaph the recorder  to hezekiah with  their  clothes rent  and told him the words of rabshakeh   
  kings    
   and it came to pass  when king hezekiah heard  it   that he rent his clothes  and covered himself with sackcloth  and went into the house of the lord   
  and he sent eliakim  which  was  over the household  and shebna the scribe  and the elders of the priests  covered with sackcloth  to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz   
  and they said unto him  thus saith hezekiah  this day  is  a day of trouble  and of rebuke  and blasphemy  for the children are come to the birth  and  there is  not strength to bring forth   
  it may be the lord thy god will hear all the words of rabshakeh  whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god  and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard  wherefore lift up  thy  prayer for the remnant that are left   
  so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah   
  and isaiah said unto them  thus shall ye say to your master  thus saith the lord  be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard  with which the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me   
  behold  i will send a blast upon him  and he shall hear a rumour  and shall return to his own land  and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land   
   so rabshakeh returned  and found the king of assyria warring against libnah  for he had heard that he was departed from lachish   
  and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia  behold  he is come out to fight against thee  he sent messengers again unto hezekiah  saying   
   thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah  saying  let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee  saying  jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria   
   behold  thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands  by destroying them utterly  and shalt thou be delivered   
   have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed   as  gozan  and haran  and rezeph  and the children of eden which  were  in thelasar   
   where  is  the king of hamath  and the king of arpad  and the king of the city of sepharvaim  of hena  and ivah   
   and hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers  and read it  and hezekiah went up into the house of the lord  and spread it before the lord   
   and hezekiah prayed before the lord  and said  o lord god of israel  which dwellest  between  the cherubims  thou art the god   even  thou alone  of all the kingdoms of the earth  thou hast made heaven and earth   
   lord  bow down thine ear  and hear  open  lord  thine eyes  and see  and hear the words of sennacherib  which hath sent him to reproach the living god   
   of a truth  lord  the kings of assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands   
   and have cast their gods into the fire  for they  were  no gods  but the work of men s hands  wood and stone  therefore they have destroyed them   
   now therefore  o lord our god  i beseech thee  save thou us out of his hand  that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou  art  the lord god   even  thou only   
    then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah  saying  thus saith the lord god of israel   that  which thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria i have heard   
   this  is  the word that the lord hath spoken concerning him  the virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee   and  laughed thee to scorn  the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee   
   whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed  and against whom hast thou exalted  thy  voice  and lifted up thine eyes on high   even  against the holy  one  of israel   
   by thy messengers thou hast reproached the lord  and hast said  with the multitude of my chariots i am come up to the height of the mountains  to the sides of lebanon  and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof   and  the choice fir trees thereof  and i will enter into the lodgings of his borders   and into  the forest of his carmel   
   i have digged and drunk strange waters  and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of besieged places   
   hast thou not heard long ago  how  i have done it   and  of ancient times that i have formed it  now have i brought it to pass  that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities  into  ruinous heaps   
   therefore their inhabitants were of small power  they were dismayed and confounded  they were  as  the grass of the field  and  as  the green herb   as  the grass on the housetops  and  as corn  blasted before it be grown up   
   but i know thy abode  and thy going out  and thy coming in  and thy rage against me   
   because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears  therefore i will put my hook in thy nose  and my bridle in thy lips  and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest   
   and this  shall be  a sign unto thee  ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves  and in the second year that which springeth of the same  and in the third year sow ye  and reap  and plant vineyards  and eat the fruits thereof   
   and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall yet again take root downward  and bear fruit upward   
   for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant  and they that escape out of mount zion  the zeal of the lord  of hosts  shall do this   
   therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria  he shall not come into this city  nor shoot an arrow there  nor come before it with shield  nor cast a bank against it   
   by the way that he came  by the same shall he return  and shall not come into this city  saith the lord   
   for i will defend this city  to save it  for mine own sake  and for my servant david s sake   
    and it came to pass that night  that the angel of the lord went out  and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand  and when they arose early in the morning  behold  they  were  all dead corpses   
   so sennacherib king of assyria departed  and went and returned  and dwelt at nineveh   
   and it came to pass  as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god  that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword  and they escaped into the land of armenia  and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead   
  kings    
   in those days was hezekiah sick unto death  and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz came to him  and said unto him  thus saith the lord  set thine house in order  for thou shalt die  and not live   
  then he turned his face to the wall  and prayed unto the lord  saying   
  i beseech thee  o lord  remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart  and have done  that which is  good in thy sight  and hezekiah wept sore   
  and it came to pass  afore isaiah was gone out into the middle court  that the word of the lord came to him  saying   
  turn again  and tell hezekiah the captain of my people  thus saith the lord  the god of david thy father  i have heard thy prayer  i have seen thy tears  behold  i will heal thee  on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord   
  and i will add unto thy days fifteen years  and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria  and i will defend this city for mine own sake  and for my servant david s sake   
  and isaiah said  take a lump of figs  and they took and laid  it  on the boil  and he recovered   
  and hezekiah said unto isaiah  what  shall be  the sign that the lord will heal me  and that i shall go up into the house of the lord the third day   
  and isaiah said  this sign shalt thou have of the lord  that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken  shall the shadow go forward ten degrees  or go back ten degrees   
   and hezekiah answered  it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees  nay  but let the shadow return backward ten degrees   
   and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord  and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward  by which it had gone down in the dial of ahaz   
    at that time berodachbaladan  the son of baladan  king of babylon  sent letters and a present unto hezekiah  for he had heard that hezekiah had been sick   
   and hezekiah hearkened unto them  and shewed them all the house of his precious things  the silver  and the gold  and the spices  and the precious ointment  and  all  the house of his armour  and all that was found in his treasures  there was nothing in his house  nor in all his dominion  that hezekiah shewed them not   
   then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah  and said unto him  what said these men  and from whence came they unto thee  and hezekiah said  they are come from a far country   even  from babylon   
   and he said  what have they seen in thine house  and hezekiah answered  all  the things  that  are  in mine house have they seen  there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them   
   and isaiah said unto hezekiah  hear the word of the lord   
   behold  the days come  that all that  is  in thine house  and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day  shall be carried into babylon  nothing shall be left  saith the lord   
   and of thy sons that shall issue from thee  which thou shalt beget  shall they take away  and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon   
   then said hezekiah unto isaiah  good  is  the word of the lord which thou hast spoken  and he said   is it  not  good   if peace and truth be in my days   
   and the rest of the acts of hezekiah  and all his might  and how he made a pool  and a conduit  and brought water into the city   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
   and hezekiah slept with his fathers  and manasseh his son reigned in his stead   
  kings    
   manasseh  was  twelve years old when he began to reign  and reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  hephzibah   
  and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  after the abominations of the heathen  whom the lord cast out before the children of israel   
  for he built up again the high places which hezekiah his father had destroyed  and he reared up altars for baal  and made a grove  as did ahab king of israel  and worshipped all the host of heaven  and served them   
  and he built altars in the house of the lord  of which the lord said  in jerusalem will i put my name   
  and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord   
  and he made his son pass through the fire  and observed times  and used enchantments  and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards  he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the lord  to provoke  him  to anger   
  and he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house  of which the lord said to david  and to solomon his son  in this house  and in jerusalem  which i have chosen out of all tribes of israel  will i put my name for ever   
  neither will i make the feet of israel move any more out of the land which i gave their fathers  only if they will observe to do according to all that i have commanded them  and according to all the law that my servant moses commanded them   
  but they hearkened not  and manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the lord destroyed before the children of israel   
    and the lord spake by his servants the prophets  saying   
   because manasseh king of judah hath done these abominations   and  hath done wickedly above all that the amorites did  which  were  before him  and hath made judah also to sin with his idols   
   therefore thus saith the lord god of israel  behold  i  am  bringing  such  evil upon jerusalem and judah  that whosoever heareth of it  both his ears shall tingle   
   and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria  and the plummet of the house of ahab  and i will wipe jerusalem as  a man  wipeth a dish  wiping  it   and turning  it  upside down   
   and i will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance  and deliver them into the hand of their enemies  and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies   
   because they have done  that which was  evil in my sight  and have provoked me to anger  since the day their fathers came forth out of egypt  even unto this day   
   moreover manasseh shed innocent blood very much  till he had filled jerusalem from one end to another  beside his sin wherewith he made judah to sin  in doing  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord   
   now the rest of the acts of manasseh  and all that he did  and his sin that he sinned   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
   and manasseh slept with his fathers  and was buried in the garden of his own house  in the garden of uzza  and amon his son reigned in his stead   
    amon  was  twenty and two years old when he began to reign  and he reigned two years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  meshullemeth  the daughter of haruz of jotbah   
   and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  as his father manasseh did   
   and he walked in all the way that his father walked in  and served the idols that his father served  and worshipped them   
   and he forsook the lord god of his fathers  and walked not in the way of the lord   
   and the servants of amon conspired against him  and slew the king in his own house   
   and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon  and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead   
   now the rest of the acts of amon which he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
   and he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of uzza  and josiah his son reigned in his stead   
  kings    
   josiah  was  eight years old when he began to reign  and he reigned thirty and one years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  jedidah  the daughter of adaiah of boscath   
  and he did  that which was  right in the sight of the lord  and walked in all the way of david his father  and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left   
  and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah   that  the king sent shaphan the son of azaliah  the son of meshullam  the scribe  to the house of the lord  saying   
  go up to hilkiah the high priest  that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the lord  which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people   
  and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work  that have the oversight of the house of the lord  and let them give it to the doers of the work which  is  in the house of the lord  to repair the breaches of the house   
  unto carpenters  and builders  and masons  and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house   
  howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand  because they dealt faithfully   
  and hilkiah the high priest said unto shaphan the scribe  i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord  and hilkiah gave the book to shaphan  and he read it   
  and shaphan the scribe came to the king  and brought the king word again  and said  thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house  and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work  that have the oversight of the house of the lord   
   and shaphan the scribe shewed the king  saying  hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book  and shaphan read it before the king   
    and it came to pass  when the king had heard the words of the book of the law  that he rent his clothes   
   and the king commanded hilkiah the priest  and ahikam the son of shaphan  and achbor the son of michaiah  and shaphan the scribe  and asahiah a servant of the king s  saying   
   go ye  enquire of the lord for me  and for the people  and for all judah  concerning the words of this book that is found  for great  is  the wrath of the lord that is kindled against us  because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book  to do according unto all that which is written concerning us   
   so hilkiah the priest  and ahikam  and achbor  and shaphan  and asahiah  went unto huldah the prophetess  the wife of shallum the son of tikvah  the son of harhas  keeper of the wardrobe   now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college   and they communed with her   
   and she said unto them  thus saith the lord god of israel  tell the man that sent you to me   
   thus saith the lord  behold  i will bring evil upon this place  and upon the inhabitants thereof   even  all the words of the book which the king of judah hath read   
   because they have forsaken me  and have burned incense unto other gods  that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands  therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place  and shall not be quenched   
   but to the king of judah which sent you to enquire of the lord  thus shall ye say to him  thus saith the lord god of israel   as touching  the words which thou hast heard   
   because thine heart was tender  and thou hast humbled thyself before the lord  when thou heardest what i spake against this place  and against the inhabitants thereof  that they should become a desolation and a curse  and hast rent thy clothes  and wept before me  i also have heard  thee   saith the lord   
   behold therefore  i will gather thee unto thy fathers  and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace  and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which i will bring upon this place  and they brought the king word again   
  kings    
   and the king sent  and they gathered unto him all the elders of judah and of jerusalem   
  and the king went up into the house of the lord  and all the men of judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with him  and the priests  and the prophets  and all the people  both small and great  and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the lord   
  and the king stood by a pillar  and made a covenant before the lord  to walk after the lord  and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all  their  heart and all  their  soul  to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book  and all the people stood to the covenant   
   and the king commanded hilkiah the high priest  and the priests of the second order  and the keepers of the door  to bring forth out of the temple of the lord all the vessels that were made for baal  and for the grove  and for all the host of heaven  and he burned them without jerusalem in the fields of kidron  and carried the ashes of them unto bethel   
  and he put down the idolatrous priests  whom the kings of judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of judah  and in the places round about jerusalem  them also that burned incense unto baal  to the sun  and to the moon  and to the planets  and to all the host of heaven   
  and he brought out the grove from the house of the lord  without jerusalem  unto the brook kidron  and burned it at the brook kidron  and stamped  it  small to powder  and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people   
  and he brake down the houses of the sodomites  that  were  by the house of the lord  where the women wove hangings for the grove   
  and he brought all the priests out of the cities of judah  and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense  from geba to beersheba  and brake down the high places of the gates that  were  in the entering in of the gate of joshua the governor of the city  which  were  on a man s left hand at the gate of the city   
  nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the lord in jerusalem  but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren   
   and he defiled topheth  which  is  in the valley of the children of hinnom  that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to molech   
   and he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given to the sun  at the entering in of the house of the lord  by the chamber of nathanmelech the chamberlain  which  was  in the suburbs  and burned the chariots of the sun with fire   
   and the altars that  were  on the top of the upper chamber of ahaz  which the kings of judah had made  and the altars which manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the lord  did the king beat down  and brake  them  down from thence  and cast the dust of them into the brook kidron   
   and the high places that  were  before jerusalem  which  were  on the right hand of the mount of corruption  which solomon the king of israel had builded for ashtoreth the abomination of the zidonians  and for chemosh the abomination of the moabites  and for milcom the abomination of the children of ammon  did the king defile   
   and he brake in pieces the images  and cut down the groves  and filled their places with the bones of men   
   moreover the altar that  was  at bethel   and  the high place which jeroboam the son of nebat  who made israel to sin  had made  both that altar and the high place he brake down  and burned the high place   and  stamped  it  small to powder  and burned the grove   
   and as josiah turned himself  he spied the sepulchres that  were  there in the mount  and sent  and took the bones out of the sepulchres  and burned  them  upon the altar  and polluted it  according to the word of the lord which the man of god proclaimed  who proclaimed these words   
   then he said  what title  is  that that i see  and the men of the city told him   it is  the sepulchre of the man of god  which came from judah  and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of bethel   
   and he said  let him alone  let no man move his bones  so they let his bones alone  with the bones of the prophet that came out of samaria   
   and all the houses also of the high places that  were  in the cities of samaria  which the kings of israel had made to provoke  the lord  to anger  josiah took away  and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in bethel   
   and he slew all the priests of the high places that  were  there upon the altars  and burned men s bones upon them  and returned to jerusalem   
   and the king commanded all the people  saying  keep the passover unto the lord your god  as  it is  written in the book of this covenant   
   surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged israel  nor in all the days of the kings of israel  nor of the kings of judah   
   but in the eighteenth year of king josiah   wherein  this passover was holden to the lord in jerusalem   
   moreover the  workers with  familiar spirits  and the wizards  and the images  and the idols  and all the abominations that were spied in the land of judah and in jerusalem  did josiah put away  that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that hilkiah the priest found in the house of the lord   
    and like unto him was there no king before him  that turned to the lord with all his heart  and with all his soul  and with all his might  according to all the law of moses  neither after him arose there  any  like him   
   notwithstanding the lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath  wherewith his anger was kindled against judah  because of all the provocations that manasseh had provoked him withal   
   and the lord said  i will remove judah also out of my sight  as i have removed israel  and will cast off this city jerusalem which i have chosen  and the house of which i said  my name shall be there   
   now the rest of the acts of josiah  and all that he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
   in his days pharaohnechoh king of egypt went up against the king of assyria to the river euphrates  and king josiah went against him  and he slew him at megiddo  when he had seen him   
   and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from megiddo  and brought him to jerusalem  and buried him in his own sepulchre  and the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah  and anointed him  and made him king in his father s stead   
    jehoahaz  was  twenty and three years old when he began to reign  and he reigned three months in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  hamutal  the daughter of jeremiah of libnah   
   and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  according to all that his fathers had done   
   and pharaohnechoh put him in bands at riblah in the land of hamath  that he might not reign in jerusalem  and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver  and a talent of gold   
   and pharaohnechoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in the room of josiah his father  and turned his name to jehoiakim  and took jehoahaz away  and he came to egypt  and died there   
   and jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to pharaoh  but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of pharaoh  he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land  of every one according to his taxation  to give  it  unto pharaohnechoh   
   jehoiakim  was  twenty and five years old when he began to reign  and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  zebudah  the daughter of pedaiah of rumah   
   and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  according to all that his fathers had done   
  kings    
   in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up  and jehoiakim became his servant three years  then he turned and rebelled against him   
  and the lord sent against him bands of the chaldees  and bands of the syrians  and bands of the moabites  and bands of the children of ammon  and sent them against judah to destroy it  according to the word of the lord  which he spake by his servants the prophets   
  surely at the commandment of the lord came  this  upon judah  to remove  them  out of his sight  for the sins of manasseh  according to all that he did   
  and also for the innocent blood that he shed  for he filled jerusalem with innocent blood  which the lord would not pardon   
  now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim  and all that he did   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   
  so jehoiakim slept with his fathers  and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead   
  and the king of egypt came not again any more out of his land  for the king of babylon had taken from the river of egypt unto the river euphrates all that pertained to the king of egypt   
   jehoiachin  was  eighteen years old when he began to reign  and he reigned in jerusalem three months  and his mother s name  was  nehushta  the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem   
  and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  according to all that his father had done   
   at that time the servants of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up against jerusalem  and the city was besieged   
   and nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came against the city  and his servants did besiege it   
   and jehoiachin the king of judah went out to the king of babylon  he  and his mother  and his servants  and his princes  and his officers  and the king of babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign   
   and he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the lord  and the treasures of the king s house  and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which solomon king of israel had made in the temple of the lord  as the lord had said   
   and he carried away all jerusalem  and all the princes  and all the mighty men of valour   even  ten thousand captives  and all the craftsmen and smiths  none remained  save the poorest sort of the people of the land   
   and he carried away jehoiachin to babylon  and the king s mother  and the king s wives  and his officers  and the mighty of the land   those  carried he into captivity from jerusalem to babylon   
   and all the men of might   even  seven thousand  and craftsmen and smiths a thousand  all  that were  strong  and  apt for war  even them the king of babylon brought captive to babylon   
   and the king of babylon made mattaniah his father s brother king in his stead  and changed his name to zedekiah   
   zedekiah  was  twenty and one years old when he began to reign  and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  hamutal  the daughter of jeremiah of libnah   
   and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  according to all that jehoiakim had done   
   for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah  until he had cast them out from his presence  that zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon   
  kings    
   and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign  in the tenth month  in the tenth  day  of the month   that  nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came  he  and all his host  against jerusalem  and pitched against it  and they built forts against it round about   
  and the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah   
  and on the ninth  day  of the  fourth  month the famine prevailed in the city  and there was no bread for the people of the land   
  and the city was broken up  and all the men of war  fled  by night by the way of the gate between two walls  which  is  by the king s garden   now the chaldees  were  against the city round about   and  the king  went the way toward the plain   
  and the army of the chaldees pursued after the king  and overtook him in the plains of jericho  and all his army were scattered from him   
  so they took the king  and brought him up to the king of babylon to riblah  and they gave judgment upon him   
  and they slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes  and put out the eyes of zedekiah  and bound him with fetters of brass  and carried him to babylon   
   and in the fifth month  on the seventh  day  of the month  which  is  the nineteenth year of king nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  came nebuzaradan  captain of the guard  a servant of the king of babylon  unto jerusalem   
  and he burnt the house of the lord  and the king s house  and all the houses of jerusalem  and every great  man s  house burnt he with fire   
   and all the army of the chaldees  that  were with  the captain of the guard  brake down the walls of jerusalem round about   
   now the rest of the people  that were  left in the city  and the fugitives that fell away to the king of babylon  with the remnant of the multitude  did nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away   
   but the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land  to be  vinedressers and husbandmen   
   and the pillars of brass that  were  in the house of the lord  and the bases  and the brasen sea that  was  in the house of the lord  did the chaldees break in pieces  and carried the brass of them to babylon   
   and the pots  and the shovels  and the snuffers  and the spoons  and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered  took they away   
   and the firepans  and the bowls   and  such things as  were  of gold   in  gold  and of silver   in  silver  the captain of the guard took away   
   the two pillars  one sea  and the bases which solomon had made for the house of the lord  the brass of all these vessels was without weight   
   the height of the one pillar  was  eighteen cubits  and the chapiter upon it  was  brass  and the height of the chapiter three cubits  and the wreathen work  and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about  all of brass  and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work   
   and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest  and zephaniah the second priest  and the three keepers of the door   
   and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war  and five men of them that were in the king s presence  which were found in the city  and the principal scribe of the host  which mustered the people of the land  and threescore men of the people of the land  that were  found in the city   
   and nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these  and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah   
   and the king of babylon smote them  and slew them at riblah in the land of hamath  so judah was carried away out of their land   
    and  as for  the people that remained in the land of judah  whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had left  even over them he made gedaliah the son of ahikam  the son of shaphan  ruler   
   and when all the captains of the armies  they and their men  heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah governor  there came to gedaliah to mizpah  even ishmael the son of nethaniah  and johanan the son of careah  and seraiah the son of tanhumeth the netophathite  and jaazaniah the son of a maachathite  they and their men   
   and gedaliah sware to them  and to their men  and said unto them  fear not to be the servants of the chaldees  dwell in the land  and serve the king of babylon  and it shall be well with you   
   but it came to pass in the seventh month  that ishmael the son of nethaniah  the son of elishama  of the seed royal  came  and ten men with him  and smote gedaliah  that he died  and the jews and the chaldees that were with him at mizpah   
   and all the people  both small and great  and the captains of the armies  arose  and came to egypt  for they were afraid of the chaldees   
   and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah  in the twelfth month  on the seven and twentieth  day  of the month   that  evilmerodach king of babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of jehoiachin king of judah out of prison   
   and he spake kindly to him  and set his throne above the throne of the kings that  were  with him in babylon   
   and changed his prison garments  and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life   
   and his allowance  was  a continual allowance given him of the king  a daily rate for every day  all the days of his life

   all these  which were  chosen to be porters in the gates  were  two hundred and twelve  these were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages  whom david and samuel the seer did ordain in their set office

   in four quarters were the porters  toward the east  west  north  and south   
   and their brethren   which were  in their villages   were  to come after seven days from time to time with them

  chronicles    
   now the philistines fought against israel  and the men of israel fled from before the philistines  and fell down slain in mount gilboa   
  and the philistines followed hard after saul  and after his sons  and the philistines slew jonathan  and abinadab  and malchishua  the sons of saul   
  and the battle went sore against saul  and the archers hit him  and he was wounded of the archers   
  then said saul to his armourbearer  draw thy sword  and thrust me through therewith  lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me  but his armourbearer would not  for he was sore afraid  so saul took a sword  and fell upon it   
  and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead  he fell likewise on the sword  and died   
  so saul died  and his three sons  and all his house died together   
  and when all the men of israel that  were  in the valley saw that they fled  and that saul and his sons were dead  then they forsook their cities  and fled  and the philistines came and dwelt in them   
   and it came to pass on the morrow  when the philistines came to strip the slain  that they found saul and his sons fallen in mount gilboa   
  and when they had stripped him  they took his head  and his armour  and sent into the land of the philistines round about  to carry tidings unto their idols  and to the people   
   and they put his armour in the house of their gods  and fastened his head in the temple of dagon   
   and when all jabeshgilead heard all that the philistines had done to saul   
   they arose  all the valiant men  and took away the body of saul  and the bodies of his sons  and brought them to jabesh  and buried their bones under the oak in jabesh  and fasted seven days   
   so saul died for his transgression which he committed against the lord   even  against the word of the lord  which he kept not  and also for asking  counsel  of  one that had  a familiar spirit  to enquire  of it    
   and enquired not of the lord  therefore he slew him  and turned the kingdom unto david the son of jesse   
  chronicles    
   then all israel gathered themselves to david unto hebron  saying  behold  we  are  thy bone and thy flesh   
  and moreover in time past  even when saul was king  thou  wast  he that leddest out and broughtest in israel  and the lord thy god said unto thee  thou shalt feed my people israel  and thou shalt be ruler over my people israel   
  therefore came all the elders of israel to the king to hebron  and david made a covenant with them in hebron before the lord  and they anointed david king over israel  according to the word of the lord by samuel   
  and david and all israel went to jerusalem  which  is  jebus  where the jebusites  were   the inhabitants of the land   
  and the inhabitants of jebus said to david  thou shalt not come hither  nevertheless david took the castle of zion  which  is  the city of david   
  and david said  whosoever smiteth the jebusites first shall be chief and captain  so joab the son of zeruiah went first up  and was chief   
  and david dwelt in the castle  therefore they called it the city of david   
  and he built the city round about  even from millo round about  and joab repaired the rest of the city   
  so david waxed greater and greater  for the lord of hosts  was  with him   
    these also  are  the chief of the mighty men whom david had  who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom   and  with all israel  to make him king  according to the word of the lord concerning israel   
   and this  is  the number of the mighty men whom david had  jashobeam  an hachmonite  the chief of the captains  he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain  by him  at one time   
   and after him  was  eleazar the son of dodo  the ahohite  who  was one  of the three mighties   
   he was with david at pasdammim  and there the philistines were gathered together to battle  where was a parcel of ground full of barley  and the people fled from before the philistines   
   and they set themselves in the midst of  that  parcel  and delivered it  and slew the philistines  and the lord saved  them  by a great deliverance   
   now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to david  into the cave of adullam  and the host of the philistines encamped in the valley of rephaim   
   and david  was  then in the hold  and the philistines  garrison  was  then at bethlehem   
   and david longed  and said  oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem  that  is  at the gate   
   and the three brake through the host of the philistines  and drew water out of the well of bethlehem  that  was  by the gate  and took  it   and brought  it  to david  but david would not drink  of  it  but poured it out to the lord   
   and said  my god forbid it me  that i should do this thing  shall i drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy  for with  the jeopardy of  their lives they brought it  therefore he would not drink it  these things did these three mightiest   
   and abishai the brother of joab  he was chief of the three  for lifting up his spear against three hundred  he slew  them   and had a name among the three   
   of the three  he was more honourable than the two  for he was their captain  howbeit he attained not to the  first  three   
   benaiah the son of jehoiada  the son of a valiant man of kabzeel  who had done many acts  he slew two lionlike men of moab  also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day   
   and he slew an egyptian  a man of  great  stature  five cubits high  and in the egyptian s hand  was  a spear like a weaver s beam  and he went down to him with a staff  and plucked the spear out of the egyptian s hand  and slew him with his own spear   
   these  things  did benaiah the son of jehoiada  and had the name among the three mighties   
   behold  he was honourable among the thirty  but attained not to the  first  three  and david set him over his guard

   and there came of the children of benjamin and judah to the hold unto david   
   and david went out to meet them  and answered and said unto them  if ye be come peaceably unto me to help me  mine heart shall be knit unto you  but if  ye be come  to betray me to mine enemies  seeing  there is  no wrong in mine hands  the god of our fathers look  thereon   and rebuke  it    
   then the spirit came upon amasai   who was  chief of the captains   and he said   thine  are we   david  and on thy side  thou son of jesse  peace  peace  be  unto thee  and peace  be  to thine helpers  for thy god helpeth thee  then david received them  and made them captains of the band   
   and there fell  some  of manasseh to david  when he came with the philistines against saul to battle  but they helped them not  for the lords of the philistines upon advisement sent him away  saying  he will fall to his master saul to  the jeopardy of  our heads   
   as he went to ziklag  there fell to him of manasseh  adnah  and jozabad  and jediael  and michael  and jozabad  and elihu  and zilthai  captains of the thousands that  were  of manasseh   
   and they helped david against the band  of the rovers   for they  were  all mighty men of valour  and were captains in the host   
   for at  that  time day by day there came to david to help him  until  it was  a great host  like the host of god   
    and these  are  the numbers of the bands  that were  ready armed to the war   and  came to david to hebron  to turn the kingdom of saul to him  according to the word of the lord   
   the children of judah that bare shield and spear  were  six thousand and eight hundred  ready armed to the war   
   of the children of simeon  mighty men of valour for the war  seven thousand and one hundred   
   of the children of levi four thousand and six hundred   
   and jehoiada  was  the leader of the aaronites  and with him  were  three thousand and seven hundred   
   and zadok  a young man mighty of valour  and of his father s house twenty and two captains   
   and of the children of benjamin  the kindred of saul  three thousand  for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of saul   
   and of the children of ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred  mighty men of valour  famous throughout the house of their fathers   
   and of the half tribe of manasseh eighteen thousand  which were expressed by name  to come and make david king   
   and of the children of issachar   which were men  that had understanding of the times  to know what israel ought to do  the heads of them  were  two hundred  and all their brethren  were  at their commandment   
   of zebulun  such as went forth to battle  expert in war  with all instruments of war  fifty thousand  which could keep rank   they were  not of double heart   
   and of naphtali a thousand captains  and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand   
   and of the danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred   
   and of asher  such as went forth to battle  expert in war  forty thousand   
   and on the other side of jordan  of the reubenites  and the gadites  and of the half tribe of manasseh  with all manner of instruments of war for the battle  an hundred and twenty thousand   
   all these men of war  that could keep rank  came with a perfect heart to hebron  to make david king over all israel  and all the rest also of israel  were  of one heart to make david king   
   and there they were with david three days  eating and drinking  for their brethren had prepared for them   
   moreover they that were nigh them   even  unto issachar and zebulun and naphtali  brought bread on asses  and on camels  and on mules  and on oxen   and  meat  meal  cakes of figs  and bunches of raisins  and wine  and oil  and oxen  and sheep abundantly  for  there was  joy in israel   
  chronicles    
   and david consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds   and  with every leader   
  and david said unto all the congregation of israel  if  it seem  good unto you  and  that it be  of the lord our god  let us send abroad unto our brethren every where   that are  left in all the land of israel  and with them  also  to the priests and levites  which are  in their cities  and  suburbs  that they may gather themselves unto us   
  and let us bring again the ark of our god to us  for we enquired not at it in the days of saul   
  and all the congregation said that they would do so  for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people   
  so david gathered all israel together  from shihor of egypt even unto the entering of hemath  to bring the ark of god from kirjathjearim   
  and david went up  and all israel  to baalah   that is   to kirjathjearim  which  belonged  to judah  to bring up thence the ark of god the lord  that dwelleth  between  the cherubims  whose name is called  on it    
  and they carried the ark of god in a new cart out of the house of abinadab  and uzza and ahio drave the cart   
  and david and all israel played before god with all  their  might  and with singing  and with harps  and with psalteries  and with timbrels  and with cymbals  and with trumpets   
   and when they came unto the threshingfloor of chidon  uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark  for the oxen stumbled   
   and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzza  and he smote him  because he put his hand to the ark  and there he died before god   
   and david was displeased  because the lord had made a breach upon uzza  wherefore that place is called perezuzza to this day   
   and david was afraid of god that day  saying  how shall i bring the ark of god  home  to me   
   so david brought not the ark  home  to himself to the city of david  but carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite   
   and the ark of god remained with the family of obededom in his house three months  and the lord blessed the house of obededom  and all that he had   
  chronicles    
   now hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david  and timber of cedars  with masons and carpenters  to build him an house   
  and david perceived that the lord had confirmed him king over israel  for his kingdom was lifted up on high  because of his people israel   
  and david took more wives at jerusalem  and david begat more sons and daughters   
  now these  are  the names of  his  children which he had in jerusalem  shammua  and shobab  nathan  and solomon   
  and ibhar  and elishua  and elpalet   
  and nogah  and nepheg  and japhia   
  and elishama  and beeliada  and eliphalet   
   and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over all israel  all the philistines went up to seek david  and david heard  of it   and went out against them   
  and the philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim   
   and david enquired of god  saying  shall i go up against the philistines  and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand  and the lord said unto him  go up  for i will deliver them into thine hand   
   so they came up to baalperazim  and david smote them there  then david said  god hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters  therefore they called the name of that place baalperazim   
   and when they had left their gods there  david gave a commandment  and they were burned with fire   
   and the philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley   
   therefore david enquired again of god  and god said unto him  go not up after them  turn away from them  and come upon them over against the mulberry trees   
   and it shall be  when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees   that  then thou shalt go out to battle  for god is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines   
   david therefore did as god commanded him  and they smote the host of the philistines from gibeon even to gazer   
   and the fame of david went out into all lands  and the lord brought the fear of him upon all nations   
  chronicles    
   and  david  made him houses in the city of david  and prepared a place for the ark of god  and pitched for it a tent   
  then david said  none ought to carry the ark of god but the levites  for them hath the lord chosen to carry the ark of god  and to minister unto him for ever   
  and david gathered all israel together to jerusalem  to bring up the ark of the lord unto his place  which he had prepared for it   
  and david assembled the children of aaron  and the levites   
  of the sons of kohath  uriel the chief  and his brethren an hundred and twenty   
  of the sons of merari  asaiah the chief  and his brethren two hundred and twenty   
  of the sons of gershom  joel the chief  and his brethren an hundred and thirty   
  of the sons of elizaphan  shemaiah the chief  and his brethren two hundred   
  of the sons of hebron  eliel the chief  and his brethren fourscore   
   of the sons of uzziel  amminadab the chief  and his brethren an hundred and twelve   
   and david called for zadok and abiathar the priests  and for the levites  for uriel  asaiah  and joel  shemaiah  and eliel  and amminadab   
   and said unto them  ye  are  the chief of the fathers of the levites  sanctify yourselves   both  ye and your brethren  that ye may bring up the ark of the lord god of israel unto  the place that  i have prepared for it   
   for because ye  did it  not at the first  the lord our god made a breach upon us  for that we sought him not after the due order   
   so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the lord god of israel   
   and the children of the levites bare the ark of god upon their shoulders with the staves thereon  as moses commanded according to the word of the lord   
   and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint their brethren  to be  the singers with instruments of musick  psalteries and harps and cymbals  sounding  by lifting up the voice with joy   
   so the levites appointed heman the son of joel  and of his brethren  asaph the son of berechiah  and of the sons of merari their brethren  ethan the son of kushaiah   
   and with them their brethren of the second  degree   zechariah  ben  and jaaziel  and shemiramoth  and jehiel  and unni  eliab  and benaiah  and maaseiah  and mattithiah  and elipheleh  and mikneiah  and obededom  and jeiel  the porters   
   so the singers  heman  asaph  and ethan   were appointed  to sound with cymbals of brass   
   and zechariah  and aziel  and shemiramoth  and jehiel  and unni  and eliab  and maaseiah  and benaiah  with psalteries on alamoth   
   and mattithiah  and elipheleh  and mikneiah  and obededom  and jeiel  and azaziah  with harps on the sheminith to excel   
   and chenaniah  chief of the levites   was  for song  he instructed about the song  because he  was  skilful   
   and berechiah and elkanah  were  doorkeepers for the ark   
   and shebaniah  and jehoshaphat  and nethaneel  and amasai  and zechariah  and benaiah  and eliezer  the priests  did blow with the trumpets before the ark of god  and obededom and jehiah  were  doorkeepers for the ark   
    so david  and the elders of israel  and the captains over thousands  went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the house of obededom with joy   
   and it came to pass  when god helped the levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord  that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams   
   and david  was  clothed with a robe of fine linen  and all the levites that bare the ark  and the singers  and chenaniah the master of the song with the singers  david also  had  upon him an ephod of linen   
   thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord with shouting  and with sound of the cornet  and with trumpets  and with cymbals  making a noise with psalteries and harps   
   and it came to pass   as  the ark of the covenant of the lord came to the city of david  that michal the daughter of saul looking out at a window saw king david dancing and playing  and she despised him in her heart   
  chronicles    
   so they brought the ark of god  and set it in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it  and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before god   
  and when david had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings  he blessed the people in the name of the lord   
  and he dealt to every one of israel  both man and woman  to every one a loaf of bread  and a good piece of flesh  and a flagon  of wine    
  and he appointed  certain  of the levites to minister before the ark of the lord  and to record  and to thank and praise the lord god of israel   
  asaph the chief  and next to him zechariah  jeiel  and shemiramoth  and jehiel  and mattithiah  and eliab  and benaiah  and obededom  and jeiel with psalteries and with harps  but asaph made a sound with cymbals   
  benaiah also and jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god   
   then on that day david delivered first  this psalm  to thank the lord into the hand of asaph and his brethren   
  give thanks unto the lord  call upon his name  make known his deeds among the people   
  sing unto him  sing psalms unto him  talk ye of all his wondrous works   
   glory ye in his holy name  let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord   
   seek the lord and his strength  seek his face continually   
   remember his marvellous works that he hath done  his wonders  and the judgments of his mouth   
   o ye seed of israel his servant  ye children of jacob  his chosen ones   
   he  is  the lord our god  his judgments  are  in all the earth   
   be ye mindful always of his covenant  the word  which  he commanded to a thousand generations   
    even of the covenant  which he made with abraham  and of his oath unto isaac   
   and hath confirmed the same to jacob for a law   and  to israel  for  an everlasting covenant   
   saying  unto thee will i give the land of canaan  the lot of your inheritance   
   when ye were but few  even a few  and strangers in it   
   and  when  they went from nation to nation  and from  one  kingdom to another people   
   he suffered no man to do them wrong  yea  he reproved kings for their sakes   
    saying   touch not mine anointed  and do my prophets no harm   
   sing unto the lord  all the earth  shew forth from day to day his salvation   
   declare his glory among the heathen  his marvellous works among all nations   
   for great  is  the lord  and greatly to be praised  he also  is  to be feared above all gods   
   for all the gods of the people  are  idols  but the lord made the heavens   
   glory and honour  are  in his presence  strength and gladness  are  in his place   
   give unto the lord  ye kindreds of the people  give unto the lord glory and strength   
   give unto the lord the glory  due  unto his name  bring an offering  and come before him  worship the lord in the beauty of holiness   
   fear before him  all the earth  the world also shall be stable  that it be not moved   
   let the heavens be glad  and let the earth rejoice  and let  men  say among the nations  the lord reigneth   
   let the sea roar  and the fulness thereof  let the fields rejoice  and all that  is  therein   
   then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the lord  because he cometh to judge the earth   
   o give thanks unto the lord  for  he is  good  for his mercy  endureth  for ever   
   and say ye  save us  o god of our salvation  and gather us together  and deliver us from the heathen  that we may give thanks to thy holy name   and  glory in thy praise   
   blessed  be  the lord god of israel for ever and ever  and all the people said  amen  and praised the lord   
    so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord asaph and his brethren  to minister before the ark continually  as every day s work required   
   and obededom with their brethren  threescore and eight  obededom also the son of jeduthun and hosah  to be  porters   
   and zadok the priest  and his brethren the priests  before the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that  was  at gibeon   
   to offer burnt offerings unto the lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening  and  to do  according to all that is written in the law of the lord  which he commanded israel   
   and with them heman and jeduthun  and the rest that were chosen  who were expressed by name  to give thanks to the lord  because his mercy  endureth  for ever   
   and with them heman and jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound  and with musical instruments of god  and the sons of jeduthun  were  porters   
   and all the people departed every man to his house  and david returned to bless his house   
  chronicles    
   now it came to pass  as david sat in his house  that david said to nathan the prophet  lo  i dwell in an house of cedars  but the ark of the covenant of the lord  remaineth  under curtains   
  then nathan said unto david  do all that  is  in thine heart  for god  is  with thee   
  and it came to pass the same night  that the word of god came to nathan  saying   
  go and tell david my servant  thus saith the lord  thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in   
  for i have not dwelt in an house since the day that i brought up israel unto this day  but have gone from tent to tent  and from  one  tabernacle  to another    
  wheresoever i have walked with all israel  spake i a word to any of the judges of israel  whom i commanded to feed my people  saying  why have ye not built me an house of cedars   
  now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant david  thus saith the lord of hosts  i took thee from the sheepcote   even  from following the sheep  that thou shouldest be ruler over my people israel   
  and i have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked  and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee  and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that  are  in the earth   
  also i will ordain a place for my people israel  and will plant them  and they shall dwell in their place  and shall be moved no more  neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more  as at the beginning   
   and since the time that i commanded judges  to be  over my people israel  moreover i will subdue all thine enemies  furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee an house   
   and it shall come to pass  when thy days be expired that thou must go  to be  with thy fathers  that i will raise up thy seed after thee  which shall be of thy sons  and i will establish his kingdom   
   he shall build me an house  and i will stablish his throne for ever   
   i will be his father  and he shall be my son  and i will not take my mercy away from him  as i took  it  from  him  that was before thee   
   but i will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever  and his throne shall be established for evermore   
   according to all these words  and according to all this vision  so did nathan speak unto david   
    and david the king came and sat before the lord  and said  who  am  i  o lord god  and what  is  mine house  that thou hast brought me hitherto   
   and  yet  this was a small thing in thine eyes  o god  for thou hast  also  spoken of thy servant s house for a great while to come  and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree  o lord god   
   what can david  speak  more to thee for the honour of thy servant  for thou knowest thy servant   
   o lord  for thy servant s sake  and according to thine own heart  hast thou done all this greatness  in making known all  these  great things   
   o lord   there is  none like thee  neither  is there any  god beside thee  according to all that we have heard with our ears   
   and what one nation in the earth  is  like thy people israel  whom god went to redeem  to be  his own people  to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness  by driving out nations from before thy people  whom thou hast redeemed out of egypt   
   for thy people israel didst thou make thine own people for ever  and thou  lord  becamest their god   
   therefore now  lord  let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever  and do as thou hast said   
   let it even be established  that thy name may be magnified for ever  saying  the lord of hosts  is  the god of israel   even  a god to israel  and  let  the house of david thy servant  be  established before thee   
   for thou  o my god  hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house  therefore thy servant hath found  in his heart  to pray before thee   
   and now  lord  thou art god  and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant   
   now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant  that it may be before thee for ever  for thou blessest  o lord  and  it shall be  blessed for ever   
  chronicles    
   now after this it came to pass  that david smote the philistines  and subdued them  and took gath and her towns out of the hand of the philistines   
  and he smote moab  and the moabites became david s servants   and  brought gifts   
  and david smote hadarezer king of zobah unto hamath  as he went to stablish his dominion by the river euphrates   
  and david took from him a thousand chariots  and seven thousand horsemen  and twenty thousand footmen  david also houghed all the chariot  horses   but reserved of them an hundred chariots   
  and when the syrians of damascus came to help hadarezer king of zobah  david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men   
  then david put  garrisons  in syriadamascus  and the syrians became david s servants   and  brought gifts  thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went   
  and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadarezer  and brought them to jerusalem   
  likewise from tibhath  and from chun  cities of hadarezer  brought david very much brass  wherewith solomon made the brasen sea  and the pillars  and the vessels of brass   
   now when tou king of hamath heard how david had smitten all the host of hadarezer king of zobah   
   he sent hadoram his son to king david  to enquire of his welfare  and to congratulate him  because he had fought against hadarezer  and smitten him   for hadarezer had war with tou   and  with him  all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass   
   them also king david dedicated unto the lord  with the silver and the gold that he brought from all  these  nations  from edom  and from moab  and from the children of ammon  and from the philistines  and from amalek   
   moreover abishai the son of zeruiah slew of the edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand   
   and he put garrisons in edom  and all the edomites became david s servants  thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went   
   so david reigned over all israel  and executed judgment and justice among all his people   
   and joab the son of zeruiah  was  over the host  and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud  recorder   
   and zadok the son of ahitub  and abimelech the son of abiathar   were  the priests  and shavsha was scribe   
   and benaiah the son of jehoiada  was  over the cherethites and the pelethites  and the sons of david  were  chief about the king   
  chronicles    
   now it came to pass after this  that nahash the king of the children of ammon died  and his son reigned in his stead   
  and david said  i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash  because his father shewed kindness to me  and david sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father  so the servants of david came into the land of the children of ammon to hanun  to comfort him   
  but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun  thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father  that he hath sent comforters unto thee  are not his servants come unto thee for to search  and to overthrow  and to spy out the land   
  wherefore hanun took david s servants  and shaved them  and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks  and sent them away   
  then there went  certain   and told david how the men were served  and he sent to meet them  for the men were greatly ashamed  and the king said  tarry at jericho until your beards be grown  and  then  return   
   and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to david  hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of mesopotamia  and out of syriamaachah  and out of zobah   
  so they hired thirty and two thousand chariots  and the king of maachah and his people  who came and pitched before medeba  and the children of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities  and came to battle   
  and when david heard  of it   he sent joab  and all the host of the mighty men   
  and the children of ammon came out  and put the battle in array before the gate of the city  and the kings that were come  were  by themselves in the field   
   now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind  he chose out of all the choice of israel  and put  them  in array against the syrians   
   and the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of abishai his brother  and they set  themselves  in array against the children of ammon   
   and he said  if the syrians be too strong for me  then thou shalt help me  but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee  then i will help thee   
   be of good courage  and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people  and for the cities of our god  and let the lord do  that which is  good in his sight   
   so joab and the people that  were  with him drew nigh before the syrians unto the battle  and they fled before him   
   and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled  they likewise fled before abishai his brother  and entered into the city  then joab came to jerusalem   
   and when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse before israel  they sent messengers  and drew forth the syrians that  were  beyond the river  and shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer  went  before them   
   and it was told david  and he gathered all israel  and passed over jordan  and came upon them  and set  the battle  in array against them  so when david had put the battle in array against the syrians  they fought with him   
   but the syrians fled before israel  and david slew of the syrians seven thousand  men which fought in  chariots  and forty thousand footmen  and killed shophach the captain of the host   
   and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before israel  they made peace with david  and became his servants  neither would the syrians help the children of ammon any more   
  chronicles    
   and it came to pass  that after the year was expired  at the time that kings go out  to battle   joab led forth the power of the army  and wasted the country of the children of ammon  and came and besieged rabbah  but david tarried at jerusalem  and joab smote rabbah  and destroyed it   
  and david took the crown of their king from off his head  and found it to weigh a talent of gold  and  there were  precious stones in it  and it was set upon david s head  and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city   
  and he brought out the people that  were  in it  and cut  them  with saws  and with harrows of iron  and with axes  even so dealt david with all the cities of the children of ammon  and david and all the people returned to jerusalem   
   and it came to pass after this  that there arose war at gezer with the philistines  at which time sibbechai the hushathite slew sippai   that was  of the children of the giant  and they were subdued   
  and there was war again with the philistines  and elhanan the son of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite  whose spear staff  was  like a weaver s beam   
  and yet again there was war at gath  where was a man of  great  stature  whose fingers and toes  were  four and twenty  six  on each hand   and six  on each foot   and he also was the son of the giant   
  but when he defied israel  jonathan the son of shimea david s brother slew him   
  these were born unto the giant in gath  and they fell by the hand of david  and by the hand of his servants   
  chronicles    
   and satan stood up against israel  and provoked david to number israel   
  and david said to joab and to the rulers of the people  go  number israel from beersheba even to dan  and bring the number of them to me  that i may know  it    
  and joab answered  the lord make his people an hundred times so many more as they  be   but  my lord the king   are  they not all my lord s servants  why then doth my lord require this thing  why will he be a cause of trespass to israel   
  nevertheless the king s word prevailed against joab  wherefore joab departed  and went throughout all israel  and came to jerusalem   
  and joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto david  and all  they of  israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword  and judah  was  four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword   
  but levi and benjamin counted he not among them  for the king s word was abominable to joab   
   and god was displeased with this thing  therefore he smote israel   
  and david said unto god  i have sinned greatly  because i have done this thing  but now  i beseech thee  do away the iniquity of thy servant  for i have done very foolishly   
  and the lord spake unto gad  david s seer  saying   
   go and tell david  saying  thus saith the lord  i offer thee three  things   choose thee one of them  that i may do  it  unto thee   
   so gad came to david  and said unto him  thus saith the lord  choose thee  
   either three years  famine  or three months to be destroyed before thy foes  while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh  thee   or else three days the sword of the lord  even the pestilence  in the land  and the angel of the lord destroying throughout all the coasts of israel  now therefore advise thyself what word i shall bring again to him that sent me   
   and david said unto gad  i am in a great strait  let me fall now into the hand of the lord  for very great  are  his mercies  but let me not fall into the hand of man   
   so the lord sent pestilence upon israel  and there fell of israel seventy thousand men   
   and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it  and as he was destroying  the lord beheld  and he repented him of the evil  and said to the angel that destroyed  it is enough  stay now thine hand  and the angel of the lord stood by the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite   
   and david lifted up his eyes  and saw the angel of the lord stand between the earth and the heaven  having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem  then david and the elders  of israel  who were  clothed in sackcloth  fell upon their faces   
   and david said unto god   is it  not i  that  commanded the people to be numbered  even i it is that have sinned and done evil indeed  but  as for  these sheep  what have they done  let thine hand  i pray thee  o lord my god  be on me  and on my father s house  but not on thy people  that they should be plagued   
    then the angel of the lord commanded gad to say to david  that david should go up  and set up an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite   
   and david went up at the saying of gad  which he spake in the name of the lord   
   and ornan turned back  and saw the angel  and his four sons with him hid themselves  now ornan was threshing wheat   
   and as david came to ornan  ornan looked and saw david  and went out of the threshingfloor  and bowed himself to david with  his  face to the ground   
   then david said to ornan  grant me the place of  this  threshingfloor  that i may build an altar therein unto the lord  thou shalt grant it me for the full price  that the plague may be stayed from the people   
   and ornan said unto david  take  it  to thee  and let my lord the king do  that which is  good in his eyes  lo  i give  thee  the oxen  also  for burnt offerings  and the threshing instruments for wood  and the wheat for the meat offering  i give it all   
   and king david said to ornan  nay  but i will verily buy it for the full price  for i will not take  that  which  is  thine for the lord  nor offer burnt offerings without cost   
   so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight   
   and david built there an altar unto the lord  and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings  and called upon the lord  and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering   
   and the lord commanded the angel  and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof   
   at that time when david saw that the lord had answered him in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite  then he sacrificed there   
   for the tabernacle of the lord  which moses made in the wilderness  and the altar of the burnt offering   were  at that season in the high place at gibeon   
   but david could not go before it to enquire of god  for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord   
  chronicles    
   then david said  this  is  the house of the lord god  and this  is  the altar of the burnt offering for israel   
  and david commanded to gather together the strangers that  were  in the land of israel  and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of god   
  and david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates  and for the joinings  and brass in abundance without weight   
  also cedar trees in abundance  for the zidonians and they of tyre brought much cedar wood to david   
  and david said  solomon my son  is  young and tender  and the house  that is  to be builded for the lord  must be  exceeding magnifical  of fame and of glory throughout all countries  i will  therefore  now make preparation for it  so david prepared abundantly before his death   
   then he called for solomon his son  and charged him to build an house for the lord god of israel   
  and david said to solomon  my son  as for me  it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the lord my god   
  but the word of the lord came to me  saying  thou hast shed blood abundantly  and hast made great wars  thou shalt not build an house unto my name  because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight   
  behold  a son shall be born to thee  who shall be a man of rest  and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about  for his name shall be solomon  and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days   
   he shall build an house for my name  and he shall be my son  and i  will be  his father  and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever   
   now  my son  the lord be with thee  and prosper thou  and build the house of the lord thy god  as he hath said of thee   
   only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding  and give thee charge concerning israel  that thou mayest keep the law of the lord thy god   
   then shalt thou prosper  if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the lord charged moses with concerning israel  be strong  and of good courage  dread not  nor be dismayed   
   now  behold  in my trouble i have prepared for the house of the lord an hundred thousand talents of gold  and a thousand thousand talents of silver  and of brass and iron without weight  for it is in abundance  timber also and stone have i prepared  and thou mayest add thereto   
   moreover  there are  workmen with thee in abundance  hewers and workers of stone and timber  and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work   
   of the gold  the silver  and the brass  and the iron   there is  no number  arise  therefore   and be doing  and the lord be with thee   
    david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomon his son   saying    
    is  not the lord your god with you  and hath he  not  given you rest on every side  for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand  and the land is subdued before the lord  and before his people   
   now set your heart and your soul to seek the lord your god  arise therefore  and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god  to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord  and the holy vessels of god  into the house that is to be built to the name of the lord   
  chronicles    
   so when david was old and full of days  he made solomon his son king over israel   
  and he gathered together all the princes of israel  with the priests and the levites   
  now the levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward  and their number by their polls  man by man  was thirty and eight thousand   
  of which  twenty and four thousand  were  to set forward the work of the house of the lord  and six thousand  were  officers and judges   
  moreover four thousand  were  porters  and four thousand praised the lord with the instruments which i made   said david   to praise  therewith    
  and david divided them into courses among the sons of levi   namely   gershon  kohath  and merari   
  of the gershonites  were   laadan  and shimei   
  the sons of laadan  the chief  was  jehiel  and zetham  and joel  three   
  the sons of shimei  shelomith  and haziel  and haran  three  these  were  the chief of the fathers of laadan   
   and the sons of shimei  were   jahath  zina  and jeush  and beriah  these four  were  the sons of shimei   
   and jahath was the chief  and zizah the second  but jeush and beriah had not many sons  therefore they were in one reckoning  according to  their  father s house   
   the sons of kohath  amram  izhar  hebron  and uzziel  four   
   the sons of amram  aaron and moses  and aaron was separated  that he should sanctify the most holy things  he and his sons for ever  to burn incense before the lord  to minister unto him  and to bless in his name for ever   
   now  concerning  moses the man of god  his sons were named of the tribe of levi   
   the sons of moses  were   gershom  and eliezer   
   of the sons of gershom  shebuel  was  the chief   
   and the sons of eliezer  were   rehabiah the chief  and eliezer had none other sons  but the sons of rehabiah were very many   
   of the sons of izhar  shelomith the chief   
   of the sons of hebron  jeriah the first  amariah the second  jahaziel the third  and jekameam the fourth   
   of the sons of uzziel  michah the first  and jesiah the second   
   the sons of merari  mahli  and mushi  the sons of mahli  eleazar  and kish   
   and eleazar died  and had no sons  but daughters  and their brethren the sons of kish took them   
   the sons of mushi  mahli  and eder  and jeremoth  three   
    these  were  the sons of levi after the house of their fathers   even  the chief of the fathers  as they were counted by number of names by their polls  that did the work for the service of the house of the lord  from the age of twenty years and upward   
   for david said  the lord god of israel hath given rest unto his people  that they may dwell in jerusalem for ever   
   and also unto the levites  they shall no  more  carry the tabernacle  nor any vessels of it for the service thereof   
   for by the last words of david the levites  were  numbered from twenty years old and above   
   because their office  was  to wait on the sons of aaron for the service of the house of the lord  in the courts  and in the chambers  and in the purifying of all holy things  and the work of the service of the house of god   
   both for the shewbread  and for the fine flour for meat offering  and for the unleavened cakes  and for  that which is baked in  the pan  and for that which is fried  and for all manner of measure and size   
   and to stand every morning to thank and praise the lord  and likewise at even   
   and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the lord in the sabbaths  in the new moons  and on the set feasts  by number  according to the order commanded unto them  continually before the lord   
   and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation  and the charge of the holy  place   and the charge of the sons of aaron their brethren  in the service of the house of the lord   
  chronicles    
   now  these are  the divisions of the sons of aaron  the sons of aaron  nadab  and abihu  eleazar  and ithamar   
  but nadab and abihu died before their father  and had no children  therefore eleazar and ithamar executed the priest s office   
  and david distributed them  both zadok of the sons of eleazar  and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar  according to their offices in their service   
  and there were more chief men found of the sons of eleazar than of the sons of ithamar  and  thus  were they divided  among the sons of eleazar  there were  sixteen chief men of the house of  their  fathers  and eight among the sons of ithamar according to the house of their fathers   
  thus were they divided by lot  one sort with another  for the governors of the sanctuary  and governors  of the house  of god  were of the sons of eleazar  and of the sons of ithamar   
  and shemaiah the son of nethaneel the scribe   one  of the levites  wrote them before the king  and the princes  and zadok the priest  and ahimelech the son of abiathar  and  before  the chief of the fathers of the priests and levites  one principal household being taken for eleazar  and  one  taken for ithamar   
  now the first lot came forth to jehoiarib  the second to jedaiah   
  the third to harim  the fourth to seorim   
  the fifth to malchijah  the sixth to mijamin   
   the seventh to hakkoz  the eighth to abijah

   the one and twentieth to jachin  the two and twentieth to gamul   
   the three and twentieth to delaiah  the four and twentieth to maaziah   
   these  were  the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the lord  according to their manner  under aaron their father  as the lord god of israel had commanded him   
    and the rest of the sons of levi  were these   of the sons of amram  shubael  of the sons of shubael  jehdeiah   
   concerning rehabiah  of the sons of rehabiah  the first  was  isshiah   
   of the izharites  shelomoth  of the sons of shelomoth  jahath   
   and the sons  of hebron   jeriah  the first   amariah the second  jahaziel the third  jekameam the fourth   
    of  the sons of uzziel  michah  of the sons of michah  shamir   
   the brother of michah  was  isshiah  of the sons of isshiah  zechariah   
   the sons of merari  were  mahli and mushi  the sons of jaaziah  beno   
   the sons of merari by jaaziah  beno  and shoham  and zaccur  and ibri   
   of mahli  came  eleazar  who had no sons   
   concerning kish  the son of kish  was  jerahmeel   
   the sons also of mushi  mahli  and eder  and jerimoth  these  were  the sons of the levites after the house of their fathers   
   these likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of aaron in the presence of david the king  and zadok  and ahimelech  and the chief of the fathers of the priests and levites  even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren   
  chronicles    
   moreover david and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of asaph  and of heman  and of jeduthun  who should prophesy with harps  with psalteries  and with cymbals  and the number of the workmen according to their service was   
  of the sons of asaph  zaccur  and joseph  and nethaniah  and asarelah  the sons of asaph under the hands of asaph  which prophesied according to the order of the king   
  of jeduthun  the sons of jeduthun  gedaliah  and zeri  and jeshaiah  hashabiah  and mattithiah  six  under the hands of their father jeduthun  who prophesied with a harp  to give thanks and to praise the lord   
  of heman  the sons of heman  bukkiah  mattaniah  uzziel  shebuel  and jerimoth  hananiah  hanani  eliathah  giddalti  and romamtiezer  joshbekashah  mallothi  hothir   and  mahazioth   
  all these  were  the sons of heman the king s seer in the words of god  to lift up the horn  and god gave to heman fourteen sons and three daughters   
  all these  were  under the hands of their father for song  in  the house of the lord  with cymbals  psalteries  and harps  for the service of the house of god  according to the king s order to asaph  jeduthun  and heman   
  so the number of them  with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the lord   even  all that were cunning  was two hundred fourscore and eight   
   and they cast lots  ward against  ward   as well the small as the great  the teacher as the scholar

   and david assembled all the princes of israel  the princes of the tribes  and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course  and the captains over the thousands  and captains over the hundreds  and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king  and of his sons  with the officers  and with the mighty men  and with all the valiant men  unto jerusalem   
  then david the king stood up upon his feet  and said  hear me  my brethren  and my people   as for me   i  had  in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the lord  and for the footstool of our god  and had made ready for the building   
  but god said unto me  thou shalt not build an house for my name  because thou  hast been  a man of war  and hast shed blood   
  howbeit the lord god of israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over israel for ever  for he hath chosen judah  to be  the ruler  and of the house of judah  the house of my father  and among the sons of my father he liked me to make  me  king over all israel   
  and of all my sons   for the lord hath given me many sons   he hath chosen solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the lord over israel   
  and he said unto me  solomon thy son  he shall build my house and my courts  for i have chosen him  to be  my son  and i will be his father   
  moreover i will establish his kingdom for ever  if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments  as at this day   
  now therefore in the sight of all israel the congregation of the lord  and in the audience of our god  keep and seek for all the commandments of the lord your god  that ye may possess this good land  and leave  it  for an inheritance for your children after you for ever   
  and thou  solomon my son  know thou the god of thy father  and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind  for the lord searcheth all hearts  and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts  if thou seek him  he will be found of thee  but if thou forsake him  he will cast thee off for ever   
   take heed now  for the lord hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary  be strong  and do  it    
    then david gave to solomon his son the pattern of the porch  and of the houses thereof  and of the treasuries thereof  and of the upper chambers thereof  and of the inner parlours thereof  and of the place of the mercy seat   
   and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit  of the courts of the house of the lord  and of all the chambers round about  of the treasuries of the house of god  and of the treasuries of the dedicated things   
   also for the courses of the priests and the levites  and for all the work of the service of the house of the lord  and for all the vessels of service in the house of the lord   
    he gave  of gold by weight for  things  of gold  for all instruments of all manner of service   silver also  for all instruments of silver by weight  for all instruments of every kind of service   
   even the weight for the candlesticks of gold  and for their lamps of gold  by weight for every candlestick  and for the lamps thereof  and for the candlesticks of silver by weight   both  for the candlestick  and  also  for the lamps thereof  according to the use of every candlestick   
   and by weight  he gave  gold for the tables of shewbread  for every table  and  likewise  silver for the tables of silver   
   also pure gold for the fleshhooks  and the bowls  and the cups  and for the golden basons  he gave gold  by weight for every bason  and  likewise silver  by weight for every bason of silver   
   and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight  and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims  that spread out  their wings   and covered the ark of the covenant of the lord   
   all  this  said david   the lord made me understand in writing by  his  hand upon me   even  all the works of this pattern   
   and david said to solomon his son  be strong and of good courage  and do  it   fear not  nor be dismayed  for the lord god   even  my god   will be  with thee  he will not fail thee  nor forsake thee  until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the lord   
   and  behold  the courses of the priests and the levites   even they shall be with thee  for all the service of the house of god  and  there shall be  with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man  for any manner of service  also the princes and all the people  will be  wholly at thy commandment   
  chronicles    
   furthermore david the king said unto all the congregation  solomon my son  whom alone god hath chosen   is yet  young and tender  and the work  is  great  for the palace  is  not for man  but for the lord god   
  now i have prepared with all my might for the house of my god the gold for  things to be made  of gold  and the silver for  things  of silver  and the brass for  things  of brass  the iron for  things  of iron  and wood for  things  of wood  onyx stones  and  stones  to be set  glistering stones  and of divers colours  and all manner of precious stones  and marble stones in abundance   
  moreover  because i have set my affection to the house of my god  i have of mine own proper good  of gold and silver   which  i have given to the house of my god  over and above all that i have prepared for the holy house   
   even  three thousand talents of gold  of the gold of ophir  and seven thousand talents of refined silver  to overlay the walls of the houses  withal    
  the gold for  things  of gold  and the silver for  things  of silver  and for all manner of work  to be made  by the hands of artificers  and who  then  is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the lord   
  then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of israel  and the captains of thousands and of hundreds  with the rulers of the king s work  offered willingly   
  and gave for the service of the house of god of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams  and of silver ten thousand talents  and of brass eighteen thousand talents  and one hundred thousand talents of iron   
  and they with whom  precious  stones were found gave  them  to the treasure of the house of the lord  by the hand of jehiel the gershonite   
  then the people rejoiced  for that they offered willingly  because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the lord  and david the king also rejoiced with great joy   
    wherefore david blessed the lord before all the congregation  and david said  blessed  be  thou  lord god of israel our father  for ever and ever   
   thine  o lord   is  the greatness  and the power  and the glory  and the victory  and the majesty  for all  that is  in the heaven and in the earth  is thine   thine  is  the kingdom  o lord  and thou art exalted as head above all   
   both riches and honour  come  of thee  and thou reignest over all  and in thine hand  is  power and might  and in thine hand  it is  to make great  and to give strength unto all   
   now therefore  our god  we thank thee  and praise thy glorious name   
   but who  am  i  and what  is  my people  that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort  for all things  come  of thee  and of thine own have we given thee   
   for we  are  strangers before thee  and sojourners  as  were  all our fathers  our days on the earth  are  as a shadow  and  there is  none abiding   
   o lord our god  all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name  cometh  of thine hand  and  is  all thine own   
   i know also  my god  that thou triest the heart  and hast pleasure in uprightness  as for me  in the uprightness of mine heart i have willingly offered all these things  and now have i seen with joy thy people  which are present here  to offer willingly unto thee   
   o lord god of abraham  isaac  and of israel  our fathers  keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people  and prepare their heart unto thee   
   and give unto solomon my son a perfect heart  to keep thy commandments  thy testimonies  and thy statutes  and to do all  these things   and to build the palace   for  the which i have made provision   
   and david said to all the congregation  now bless the lord your god  and all the congregation blessed the lord god of their fathers  and bowed down their heads  and worshipped the lord  and the king   
   and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the lord  and offered burnt offerings unto the lord  on the morrow after that day   even  a thousand bullocks  a thousand rams   and  a thousand lambs  with their drink offerings  and sacrifices in abundance for all israel   
   and did eat and drink before the lord on that day with great gladness  and they made solomon the son of david king the second time  and anointed  him  unto the lord  to be  the chief governor  and zadok  to be  priest   
    then solomon sat on the throne of the lord as king instead of david his father  and prospered  and all israel obeyed him   
   and all the princes  and the mighty men  and all the sons likewise of king david  submitted themselves unto solomon the king   
   and the lord magnified solomon exceedingly in the sight of all israel  and bestowed upon him  such  royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in israel   
   thus david the son of jesse reigned over all israel   
   and the time that he reigned over israel  was  forty years  seven years reigned he in hebron  and thirty and three  years  reigned he in jerusalem   
   and he died in a good old age  full of days  riches  and honour  and solomon his son reigned in his stead   
   now the acts of david the king  first and last  behold  they  are  written in the book of samuel the seer  and in the book of nathan the prophet  and in the book of gad the seer   
   with all his reign and his might  and the times that went over him  and over israel  and over all the kingdoms of the countries   
 
  chronicles 
  chronicles   
   and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom  and the lord his god  was  with him  and magnified him exceedingly   
  then solomon spake unto all israel  to the captains of thousands and of hundreds  and to the judges  and to every governor in all israel  the chief of the fathers   
  so solomon  and all the congregation with him  went to the high place that  was  at gibeon  for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of god  which moses the servant of the lord had made in the wilderness   
  but the ark of god had david brought up from kirjathjearim to  the place which  david had prepared for it  for he had pitched a tent for it at jerusalem   
  moreover the brasen altar  that bezaleel the son of uri  the son of hur  had made  he put before the tabernacle of the lord  and solomon and the congregation sought unto it   
  and solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the lord  which  was  at the tabernacle of the congregation  and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it   
  in that night did god appear unto solomon  and said unto him  ask what i shall give thee   
  and solomon said unto god  thou hast shewed great mercy unto david my father  and hast made me to reign in his stead   
  now  o lord god  let thy promise unto david my father be established  for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude   
   give me now wisdom and knowledge  that i may go out and come in before this people  for who can judge this thy people   that is so  great   
   and god said to solomon  because this was in thine heart  and thou hast not asked riches  wealth  or honour  nor the life of thine enemies  neither yet hast asked long life  but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself  that thou mayest judge my people  over whom i have made thee king   
   wisdom and knowledge  is  granted unto thee  and i will give thee riches  and wealth  and honour  such as none of the kings have had that  have been  before thee  neither shall there any after thee have the like   
    then solomon came  from his journey  to the high place that  was  at gibeon to jerusalem  from before the tabernacle of the congregation  and reigned over israel   
   and solomon gathered chariots and horsemen  and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots  and twelve thousand horsemen  which he placed in the chariot cities  and with the king at jerusalem   
   and the king made silver and gold at jerusalem  as plenteous  as stones  and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that  are  in the vale for abundance   
   and solomon had horses brought out of egypt  and linen yarn  the king s merchants received the linen yarn at a price   
   and they fetched up  and brought forth out of egypt a chariot for six hundred  shekels  of silver  and an horse for an hundred and fifty  and so brought they out  horses  for all the kings of the hittites  and for the kings of syria  by their means   
  chronicles   
   and solomon determined to build an house for the name of the lord  and an house for his kingdom   
  and solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens  and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain  and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them   
  and solomon sent to huram the king of tyre  saying  as thou didst deal with david my father  and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein   even so deal with me    
  behold  i build an house to the name of the lord my god  to dedicate  it  to him   and  to burn before him sweet incense  and for the continual shewbread  and for the burnt offerings morning and evening  on the sabbaths  and on the new moons  and on the solemn feasts of the lord our god  this  is an ordinance  for ever to israel   
  and the house which i build  is  great  for great  is  our god above all gods   
  but who is able to build him an house  seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him  who  am  i then  that i should build him an house  save only to burn sacrifice before him   
  send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold  and in silver  and in brass  and in iron  and in purple  and crimson  and blue  and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that  are  with me in judah and in jerusalem  whom david my father did provide   
  send me also cedar trees  fir trees  and algum trees  out of lebanon  for i know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in lebanon  and  behold  my servants  shall be  with thy servants   
  even to prepare me timber in abundance  for the house which i am about to build  shall be  wonderful great   
   and  behold  i will give to thy servants  the hewers that cut timber  twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat  and twenty thousand measures of barley  and twenty thousand baths of wine  and twenty thousand baths of oil   
    then huram the king of tyre answered in writing  which he sent to solomon  because the lord hath loved his people  he hath made thee king over them   
   huram said moreover  blessed  be  the lord god of israel  that made heaven and earth  who hath given to david the king a wise son  endued with prudence and understanding  that might build an house for the lord  and an house for his kingdom   
   and now i have sent a cunning man  endued with understanding  of huram my father s   
   the son of a woman of the daughters of dan  and his father  was  a man of tyre  skilful to work in gold  and in silver  in brass  in iron  in stone  and in timber  in purple  in blue  and in fine linen  and in crimson  also to grave any manner of graving  and to find out every device which shall be put to him  with thy cunning men  and with the cunning men of my lord david thy father   
   now therefore the wheat  and the barley  the oil  and the wine  which my lord hath spoken of  let him send unto his servants   
   and we will cut wood out of lebanon  as much as thou shalt need  and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to joppa  and thou shalt carry it up to jerusalem   
   and solomon numbered all the strangers that  were  in the land of israel  after the numbering wherewith david his father had numbered them  and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred   
   and he set threescore and ten thousand of them  to be  bearers of burdens  and fourscore thousand  to be  hewers in the mountain  and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work   
  chronicles   
   then solomon began to build the house of the lord at jerusalem in mount moriah  where  the lord  appeared unto david his father  in the place that david had prepared in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite   
  and he began to build in the second  day  of the second month  in the fourth year of his reign   
  now these  are the things wherein  solomon was instructed for the building of the house of god  the length by cubits after the first measure  was  threescore cubits  and the breadth twenty cubits   
  and the porch that  was  in the front  of the house   the length  of it was  according to the breadth of the house  twenty cubits  and the height  was  an hundred and twenty  and he overlaid it within with pure gold   
  and the greater house he cieled with fir tree  which he overlaid with fine gold  and set thereon palm trees and chains   
  and he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty  and the gold  was  gold of parvaim   
  he overlaid also the house  the beams  the posts  and the walls thereof  and the doors thereof  with gold  and graved cherubims on the walls   
  and he made the most holy house  the length whereof  was  according to the breadth of the house  twenty cubits  and the breadth thereof twenty cubits  and he overlaid it with fine gold   amounting  to six hundred talents   
  and the weight of the nails  was  fifty shekels of gold  and he overlaid the upper chambers with gold   
    and in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work  and overlaid them with gold   
   and the wings of the cherubims  were  twenty cubits long  one wing  of the one cherub was  five cubits  reaching to the wall of the house  and the other wing  was likewise  five cubits  reaching to the wing of the other cherub   
   and  one  wing of the other cherub  was  five cubits  reaching to the wall of the house  and the other wing  was  five cubits  also   joining to the wing of the other cherub   
   the wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits  and they stood on their feet  and their faces  were  inward   
   and he made the vail  of  blue  and purple  and crimson  and fine linen  and wrought cherubims thereon   
   also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high  and the chapiter that  was  on the top of each of them  was  five cubits   
   and he made chains   as  in the oracle  and put  them  on the heads of the pillars  and made an hundred pomegranates  and put  them  on the chains   
   and he reared up the pillars before the temple  one on the right hand  and the other on the left  and called the name of that on the right hand jachin  and the name of that on the left boaz   
  chronicles   
   moreover he made an altar of brass  twenty cubits the length thereof  and twenty cubits the breadth thereof  and ten cubits the height thereof   
  also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim  round in compass  and five cubits the height thereof  and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about   
  and under it  was  the similitude of oxen  which did compass it round about  ten in a cubit  compassing the sea round about  two rows of oxen  were  cast  when it was cast   
  it stood upon twelve oxen  three looking toward the north  and three looking toward the west  and three looking toward the south  and three looking toward the east  and the sea  was set  above upon them  and all their hinder parts  were  inward   
  and the thickness of it  was  an handbreadth  and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup  with flowers of lilies   and  it received and held three thousand baths   
  he made also ten lavers  and put five on the right hand  and five on the left  to wash in them  such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them  but the sea  was  for the priests to wash in   
  and he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form  and set  them  in the temple  five on the right hand  and five on the left   
  he made also ten tables  and placed  them  in the temple  five on the right side  and five on the left  and he made an hundred basons of gold   
  furthermore he made the court of the priests  and the great court  and doors for the court  and overlaid the doors of them with brass   
   and he set the sea on the right side of the east end  over against the south   
    and huram made the pots  and the shovels  and the basons  and huram finished the work that he was to make for king solomon for the house of god   
    to wit   the two pillars  and the pommels  and the chapiters  which were  on the top of the two pillars  and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which  were  on the top of the pillars   
   and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths  two rows of pomegranates on each wreath  to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which  were  upon the pillars   
   he made also bases  and lavers made he upon the bases   
   one sea  and twelve oxen under it   
   the pots also  and the shovels  and the fleshhooks  and all their instruments  did huram his father make to king solomon for the house of the lord of bright brass   
   in the plain of jordan did the king cast them  in the clay ground between succoth and zeredathah   
   thus solomon made all these vessels in great abundance  for the weight of the brass could not be found out   
   and solomon made all the vessels that  were for  the house of god  the golden altar also  and the tables whereon the shewbread  was set    
   moreover the candlesticks with their lamps  that they should burn after the manner before the oracle  of pure gold   
   and the flowers  and the lamps  and the tongs   made he of  gold   and  that perfect gold   
   and the snuffers  and the basons  and the spoons  and the censers   of  pure gold  and the entry of the house  the inner doors thereof for the most holy  place   and the doors of the house of the temple   were of  gold   
  chronicles   
   thus all the work that solomon made for the house of the lord was finished  and solomon brought in  all  the things that david his father had dedicated  and the silver  and the gold  and all the instruments  put he among the treasures of the house of god   
  then solomon assembled the elders of israel  and all the heads of the tribes  the chief of the fathers of the children of israel  unto jerusalem  to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david  which  is  zion   
  wherefore all the men of israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which  was  in the seventh month   
  and all the elders of israel came  and the levites took up the ark   
  and they brought up the ark  and the tabernacle of the congregation  and all the holy vessels that  were  in the tabernacle  these did the priests  and  the levites bring up   
  also king solomon  and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him before the ark  sacrificed sheep and oxen  which could not be told nor numbered for multitude   
  and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place  to the oracle of the house  into the most holy  place  even  under the wings of the cherubims   
  for the cherubims spread forth  their  wings over the place of the ark  and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above   
  and they drew out the staves  of the ark   that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle  but they were not seen without  and there it is unto this day   
    there was  nothing in the ark save the two tables which moses put  therein  at horeb  when the lord made  a covenant  with the children of israel  when they came out of egypt   
    and it came to pass  when the priests were come out of the holy  place    for all the priests  that were  present were sanctified   and  did not  then  wait by course   
   also the levites  which were  the singers  all of them of asaph  of heman  of jeduthun  with their sons and their brethren   being  arrayed in white linen  having cymbals and psalteries and harps  stood at the east end of the altar  and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets    
   it came even to pass  as the trumpeters and singers  were  as one  to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord  and when they lifted up  their  voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick  and praised the lord   saying   for  he is  good  for his mercy  endureth  for ever  that  then  the house was filled with a cloud   even  the house of the lord   
   so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud  for the glory of the lord had filled the house of god   
  chronicles   
   then said solomon  the lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness   
  but i have built an house of habitation for thee  and a place for thy dwelling for ever   
  and the king turned his face  and blessed the whole congregation of israel  and all the congregation of israel stood   
  and he said  blessed  be  the lord god of israel  who hath with his hands fulfilled  that  which he spake with his mouth to my father david  saying   
  since the day that i brought forth my people out of the land of egypt i chose no city among all the tribes of israel to build an house in  that my name might be there  neither chose i any man to be a ruler over my people israel   
  but i have chosen jerusalem  that my name might be there  and have chosen david to be over my people israel   
  now it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel   
  but the lord said to david my father  forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name  thou didst well in that it was in thine heart   
  notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house  but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins  he shall build the house for my name   
   the lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken  for i am risen up in the room of david my father  and am set on the throne of israel  as the lord promised  and have built the house for the name of the lord god of israel   
   and in it have i put the ark  wherein  is  the covenant of the lord  that he made with the children of israel   
    and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel  and spread forth his hands   
   for solomon had made a brasen scaffold  of five cubits long  and five cubits broad  and three cubits high  and had set it in the midst of the court  and upon it he stood  and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of israel  and spread forth his hands toward heaven   
   and said  o lord god of israel   there is  no god like thee in the heaven  nor in the earth  which keepest covenant  and  shewest  mercy unto thy servants  that walk before thee with all their hearts   
   thou which hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him  and spakest with thy mouth  and hast fulfilled  it  with thine hand  as  it is  this day   
   now therefore  o lord god of israel  keep with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him  saying  there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of israel  yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law  as thou hast walked before me   
   now then  o lord god of israel  let thy word be verified  which thou hast spoken unto thy servant david   
   but will god in very deed dwell with men on the earth  behold  heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee  how much less this house which i have built   
   have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant  and to his supplication  o lord my god  to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee   
   that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night  upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there  to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place   
   hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant  and of thy people israel  which they shall make toward this place  hear thou from thy dwelling place   even  from heaven  and when thou hearest  forgive   
   if a man sin against his neighbour  and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear  and the oath come before thine altar in this house   
   then hear thou from heaven  and do  and judge thy servants  by requiting the wicked  by recompensing his way upon his own head  and by justifying the righteous  by giving him according to his righteousness   
   and if thy people israel be put to the worse before the enemy  because they have sinned against thee  and shall return and confess thy name  and pray and make supplication before thee in this house   
   then hear thou from the heavens  and forgive the sin of thy people israel  and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers   
   when the heaven is shut up  and there is no rain  because they have sinned against thee   yet  if they pray toward this place  and confess thy name  and turn from their sin  when thou dost afflict them   
   then hear thou from heaven  and forgive the sin of thy servants  and of thy people israel  when thou hast taught them the good way  wherein they should walk  and send rain upon thy land  which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance   
   if there be dearth in the land  if there be pestilence  if there be blasting  or mildew  locusts  or caterpillers  if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land  whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness  there be    
    then  what prayer  or  what supplication soever shall be made of any man  or of all thy people israel  when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief  and shall spread forth his hands in this house   
   then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place  and forgive  and render unto every man according unto all his ways  whose heart thou knowest   for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men    
   that they may fear thee  to walk in thy ways  so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers   
   moreover concerning the stranger  which is not of thy people israel  but is come from a far country for thy great name s sake  and thy mighty hand  and thy stretched out arm  if they come and pray in this house   
   then hear thou from the heavens   even  from thy dwelling place  and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for  that all people of the earth may know thy name  and fear thee  as  doth  thy people israel  and may know that this house which i have built is called by thy name   
   if thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them  and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen  and the house which i have built for thy name   
   then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication  and maintain their cause   
   if they sin against thee   for  there is  no man which sinneth not   and thou be angry with them  and deliver them over before  their  enemies  and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near   
   yet  if  they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive  and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity  saying  we have sinned  we have done amiss  and have dealt wickedly   
   if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity  whither they have carried them captives  and pray toward their land  which thou gavest unto their fathers  and  toward  the city which thou hast chosen  and toward the house which i have built for thy name   
   then hear thou from the heavens   even  from thy dwelling place  their prayer and their supplications  and maintain their cause  and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee   
   now  my god  let  i beseech thee  thine eyes be open  and  let  thine ears  be  attent unto the prayer  that is made  in this place   
   now therefore arise  o lord god  into thy resting place  thou  and the ark of thy strength  let thy priests  o lord god  be clothed with salvation  and let thy saints rejoice in goodness   
   o lord god  turn not away the face of thine anointed  remember the mercies of david thy servant   
  chronicles   
   now when solomon had made an end of praying  the fire came down from heaven  and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices  and the glory of the lord filled the house   
  and the priests could not enter into the house of the lord  because the glory of the lord had filled the lord s house   
  and when all the children of israel saw how the fire came down  and the glory of the lord upon the house  they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement  and worshipped  and praised the lord   saying   for  he is  good  for his mercy  endureth  for ever   
  then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the lord   
  and king solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen  and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep  so the king and all the people dedicated the house of god   
  and the priests waited on their offices  the levites also with instruments of musick of the lord  which david the king had made to praise the lord  because his mercy  endureth  for ever  when david praised by their ministry  and the priests sounded trumpets before them  and all israel stood   
  moreover solomon hallowed the middle of the court that  was  before the house of the lord  for there he offered burnt offerings  and the fat of the peace offerings  because the brasen altar which solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings  and the meat offerings  and the fat   
  also at the same time solomon kept the feast seven days  and all israel with him  a very great congregation  from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt   
  and in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly  for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days  and the feast seven days   
   and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents  glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the lord had shewed unto david  and to solomon  and to israel his people   
   thus solomon finished the house of the lord  and the king s house  and all that came into solomon s heart to make in the house of the lord  and in his own house  he prosperously effected   
    and the lord appeared to solomon by night  and said unto him  i have heard thy prayer  and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice   
   if i shut up heaven that there be no rain  or if i command the locusts to devour the land  or if i send pestilence among my people   
   if my people  which are called by my name  shall humble themselves  and pray  and seek my face  and turn from their wicked ways  then will i hear from heaven  and will forgive their sin  and will heal their land   
   now mine eyes shall be open  and mine ears attent unto the prayer  that is made  in this place   
   for now have i chosen and sanctified this house  that my name may be there for ever  and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually   
   and as for thee  if thou wilt walk before me  as david thy father walked  and do according to all that i have commanded thee  and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments   
   then will i stablish the throne of thy kingdom  according as i have covenanted with david thy father  saying  there shall not fail thee a man  to be  ruler in israel   
   but if ye turn away  and forsake my statutes and my commandments  which i have set before you  and shall go and serve other gods  and worship them   
   then will i pluck them up by the roots out of my land which i have given them  and this house  which i have sanctified for my name  will i cast out of my sight  and will make it  to be  a proverb and a byword among all nations   
   and this house  which is high  shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it  so that he shall say  why hath the lord done thus unto this land  and unto this house   
   and it shall be answered  because they forsook the lord god of their fathers  which brought them forth out of the land of egypt  and laid hold on other gods  and worshipped them  and served them  therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them   
  chronicles   
   and it came to pass at the end of twenty years  wherein solomon had built the house of the lord  and his own house   
  that the cities which huram had restored to solomon  solomon built them  and caused the children of israel to dwell there   
  and solomon went to hamathzobah  and prevailed against it   
  and he built tadmor in the wilderness  and all the store cities  which he built in hamath   
  also he built bethhoron the upper  and bethhoron the nether  fenced cities  with walls  gates  and bars   
  and baalath  and all the store cities that solomon had  and all the chariot cities  and the cities of the horsemen  and all that solomon desired to build in jerusalem  and in lebanon  and throughout all the land of his dominion   
   as for  all the people  that were  left of the hittites  and the amorites  and the perizzites  and the hivites  and the jebusites  which  were  not of israel   
   but  of their children  who were left after them in the land  whom the children of israel consumed not  them did solomon make to pay tribute until this day   
  but of the children of israel did solomon make no servants for his work  but they  were  men of war  and chief of his captains  and captains of his chariots and horsemen   
   and these  were  the chief of king solomon s officers   even  two hundred and fifty  that bare rule over the people   
   and solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city of david unto the house that he had built for her  for he said  my wife shall not dwell in the house of david king of israel  because  the places are  holy  whereunto the ark of the lord hath come   
    then solomon offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the altar of the lord  which he had built before the porch   
   even after a certain rate every day  offering according to the commandment of moses  on the sabbaths  and on the new moons  and on the solemn feasts  three times in the year   even  in the feast of unleavened bread  and in the feast of weeks  and in the feast of tabernacles   
   and he appointed  according to the order of david his father  the courses of the priests to their service  and the levites to their charges  to praise and minister before the priests  as the duty of every day required  the porters also by their courses at every gate  for so had david the man of god commanded   
   and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and levites concerning any matter  or concerning the treasures   
   now all the work of solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the lord  and until it was finished   so  the house of the lord was perfected   
   then went solomon to eziongeber  and to eloth  at the sea side in the land of edom   
   and huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships  and servants that had knowledge of the sea  and they went with the servants of solomon to ophir  and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold  and brought  them  to king solomon   
  chronicles   
   and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon  she came to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem  with a very great company  and camels that bare spices  and gold in abundance  and precious stones  and when she was come to solomon  she communed with him of all that was in her heart   
  and solomon told her all her questions  and there was nothing hid from solomon which he told her not   
  and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon  and the house that he had built   
  and the meat of his table  and the sitting of his servants  and the attendance of his ministers  and their apparel  his cupbearers also  and their apparel  and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the lord  there was no more spirit in her   
  and she said to the king   it was  a true report which i heard in mine own land of thine acts  and of thy wisdom   
  howbeit i believed not their words  until i came  and mine eyes had seen  it   and  behold  the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me   for  thou exceedest the fame that i heard   
  happy  are  thy men  and happy  are  these thy servants  which stand continually before thee  and hear thy wisdom   
  blessed be the lord thy god  which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne   to be  king for the lord thy god  because thy god loved israel  to establish them for ever  therefore made he thee king over them  to do judgment and justice   
  and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold  and of spices great abundance  and precious stones  neither was there any such spice as the queen of sheba gave king solomon   
   and the servants also of huram  and the servants of solomon  which brought gold from ophir  brought algum trees and precious stones   
   and the king made  of  the algum trees terraces to the house of the lord  and to the king s palace  and harps and psalteries for singers  and there were none such seen before in the land of judah   
   and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire  whatsoever she asked  beside  that  which she had brought unto the king  so she turned  and went away to her own land  she and her servants   
    now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold   
   beside  that which  chapmen and merchants brought  and all the kings of arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to solomon   
   and king solomon made two hundred targets  of  beaten gold  six hundred  shekels  of beaten gold went to one target   
   and three hundred shields  made he of  beaten gold  three hundred  shekels  of gold went to one shield  and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon   
   moreover the king made a great throne of ivory  and overlaid it with pure gold   
   and  there were  six steps to the throne  with a footstool of gold   which were  fastened to the throne  and stays on each side of the sitting place  and two lions standing by the stays   
   and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps  there was not the like made in any kingdom   
   and all the drinking vessels of king solomon  were of  gold  and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon  were of  pure gold  none  were of  silver  it was  not  any thing accounted of in the days of solomon   
   for the king s ships went to tarshish with the servants of huram  every three years once came the ships of tarshish bringing gold  and silver  ivory  and apes  and peacocks   
   and king solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom   
   and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon  to hear his wisdom  that god had put in his heart   
   and they brought every man his present  vessels of silver  and vessels of gold  and raiment  harness  and spices  horses  and mules  a rate year by year   
   and solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots  and twelve thousand horsemen  whom he bestowed in the chariot cities  and with the king at jerusalem   
   and he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the philistines  and to the border of egypt   
   and the king made silver in jerusalem as stones  and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that  are  in the low plains in abundance   
   and they brought unto solomon horses out of egypt  and out of all lands   
   now the rest of the acts of solomon  first and last   are  they not written in the book of nathan the prophet  and in the prophecy of ahijah the shilonite  and in the visions of iddo the seer against jeroboam the son of nebat   
   and solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years   
   and solomon slept with his fathers  and he was buried in the city of david his father  and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead   
  chronicles    
   and rehoboam went to shechem  for to shechem were all israel come to make him king   
  and it came to pass  when jeroboam the son of nebat  who  was  in egypt  whither he had fled from the presence of solomon the king  heard  it   that jeroboam returned out of egypt   
  and they sent and called him  so jeroboam and all israel came and spake to rehoboam  saying   
  thy father made our yoke grievous  now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father  and his heavy yoke that he put upon us  and we will serve thee   
  and he said unto them  come again unto me after three days  and the people departed   
  and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before solomon his father while he yet lived  saying  what counsel give ye  me  to return answer to this people   
  and they spake unto him  saying  if thou be kind to this people  and please them  and speak good words to them  they will be thy servants for ever   
  but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him  and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him  that stood before him   
  and he said unto them  what advice give ye that we may return answer to this people  which have spoken to me  saying  ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us   
   and the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him  saying  thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee  saying  thy father made our yoke heavy  but make thou  it  somewhat lighter for us  thus shalt thou say unto them  my little  finger  shall be thicker than my father s loins   
   for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you  i will put more to your yoke  my father chastised you with whips  but i  will chastise you  with scorpions   
    so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam on the third day  as the king bade  saying  come again to me on the third day   
   and the king answered them roughly  and king rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men   
   and answered them after the advice of the young men  saying  my father made your yoke heavy  but i will add thereto  my father chastised you with whips  but i  will chastise you  with scorpions   
   so the king hearkened not unto the people  for the cause was of god  that the lord might perform his word  which he spake by the hand of ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat   
   and when all israel  saw  that the king would not hearken unto them  the people answered the king  saying  what portion have we in david  and  we have  none inheritance in the son of jesse  every man to your tents  o israel   and  now  david  see to thine own house  so all israel went to their tents   
   but  as for  the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of judah  rehoboam reigned over them   
   then king rehoboam sent hadoram that  was  over the tribute  and the children of israel stoned him with stones  that he died  but king rehoboam made speed to get him up to  his  chariot  to flee to jerusalem   
   and israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day   
  chronicles    
   and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem  he gathered of the house of judah and benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen  men   which were warriors  to fight against israel  that he might bring the kingdom again to rehoboam   
  but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god  saying   
  speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon  king of judah  and to all israel in judah and benjamin  saying   
  thus saith the lord  ye shall not go up  nor fight against your brethren  return every man to his house  for this thing is done of me  and they obeyed the words of the lord  and returned from going against jeroboam   
  and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem  and built cities for defence in judah   
  he built even bethlehem  and etam  and tekoa   
  and bethzur  and shoco  and adullam   
  and gath  and mareshah  and ziph   
  and adoraim  and lachish  and azekah   
   and zorah  and aijalon  and hebron  which  are  in judah and in benjamin fenced cities   
   and he fortified the strong holds  and put captains in them  and store of victual  and of oil and wine   
   and in every several city  he put  shields and spears  and made them exceeding strong  having judah and benjamin on his side   
    and the priests and the levites that  were  in all israel resorted to him out of all their coasts   
   for the levites left their suburbs and their possession  and came to judah and jerusalem  for jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest s office unto the lord   
   and he ordained him priests for the high places  and for the devils  and for the calves which he had made   
   and after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set their hearts to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem  to sacrifice unto the lord god of their fathers   
   so they strengthened the kingdom of judah  and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong  three years  for three years they walked in the way of david and solomon   
   and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david to wife   and  abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse   
   which bare him children  jeush  and shamariah  and zaham   
   and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom  which bare him abijah  and attai  and ziza  and shelomith   
   and rehoboam loved maachah the daughter of absalom above all his wives and his concubines   for he took eighteen wives  and threescore concubines  and begat twenty and eight sons  and threescore daughters    
   and rehoboam made abijah the son of maachah the chief   to be  ruler among his brethren  for  he thought  to make him king   
   and he dealt wisely  and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of judah and benjamin  unto every fenced city  and he gave them victual in abundance  and he desired many wives   
  chronicles    
   and it came to pass  when rehoboam had established the kingdom  and had strengthened himself  he forsook the law of the lord  and all israel with him   
  and it came to pass   that  in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem  because they had transgressed against the lord   
  with twelve hundred chariots  and threescore thousand horsemen  and the people  were  without number that came with him out of egypt  the lubims  the sukkiims  and the ethiopians   
  and he took the fenced cities which  pertained  to judah  and came to jerusalem   
  then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam  and  to  the princes of judah  that were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishak  and said unto them  thus saith the lord  ye have forsaken me  and therefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak   
  whereupon the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves  and they said  the lord  is  righteous   
  and when the lord saw that they humbled themselves  the word of the lord came to shemaiah  saying  they have humbled themselves   therefore  i will not destroy them  but i will grant them some deliverance  and my wrath shall not be poured out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak   
  nevertheless they shall be his servants  that they may know my service  and the service of the kingdoms of the countries   
  so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem  and took away the treasures of the house of the lord  and the treasures of the king s house  he took all  he carried away also the shields of gold which solomon had made   
   instead of which king rehoboam made shields of brass  and committed  them  to the hands of the chief of the guard  that kept the entrance of the king s house   
   and when the king entered into the house of the lord  the guard came and fetched them  and brought them again into the guard chamber   
   and when he humbled himself  the wrath of the lord turned from him  that he would not destroy  him  altogether  and also in judah things went well   
    so king rehoboam strengthened himself in jerusalem  and reigned  for rehoboam  was  one and forty years old when he began to reign  and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem  the city which the lord had chosen out of all the tribes of israel  to put his name there  and his mother s name  was  naamah an ammonitess   
   and he did evil  because he prepared not his heart to seek the lord   
   now the acts of rehoboam  first and last   are  they not written in the book of shemaiah the prophet  and of iddo the seer concerning genealogies  and  there were  wars between rehoboam and jeroboam continually   
   and rehoboam slept with his fathers  and was buried in the city of david  and abijah his son reigned in his stead   
  chronicles    
   now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign over judah   
  he reigned three years in jerusalem  his mother s name also  was  michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah  and there was war between abijah and jeroboam   
  and abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war   even  four hundred thousand chosen men  jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men   being  mighty men of valour   
  and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim  which  is  in mount ephraim  and said  hear me  thou jeroboam  and all israel   
  ought ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over israel to david for ever   even  to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt   
  yet jeroboam the son of nebat  the servant of solomon the son of david  is risen up  and hath rebelled against his lord   
  and there are gathered unto him vain men  the children of belial  and have strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon  when rehoboam was young and tenderhearted  and could not withstand them   
  and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the sons of david  and ye  be  a great multitude  and  there are  with you golden calves  which jeroboam made you for gods   
  have ye not cast out the priests of the lord  the sons of aaron  and the levites  and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of  other  lands  so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams   the same  may be a priest of  them that are  no gods   
   but as for us  the lord  is  our god  and we have not forsaken him  and the priests  which minister unto the lord   are  the sons of aaron  and the levites  wait  upon  their  business   
   and they burn unto the lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense  the shewbread also  set they in order  upon the pure table  and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof  to burn every evening  for we keep the charge of the lord our god  but ye have forsaken him   
   and  behold  god himself  is  with us for  our  captain  and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you  o children of israel  fight ye not against the lord god of your fathers  for ye shall not prosper   
    but jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them  so they were before judah  and the ambushment  was  behind them   
   and when judah looked back  behold  the battle  was  before and behind  and they cried unto the lord  and the priests sounded with the trumpets   
   then the men of judah gave a shout  and as the men of judah shouted  it came to pass  that god smote jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah   
   and the children of israel fled before judah  and god delivered them into their hand   
   and abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter  so there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men   
   thus the children of israel were brought under at that time  and the children of judah prevailed  because they relied upon the lord god of their fathers   
   and abijah pursued after jeroboam  and took cities from him  bethel with the towns thereof  and jeshanah with the towns thereof  and ephrain with the towns thereof   
   neither did jeroboam recover strength again in the days of abijah  and the lord struck him  and he died   
   but abijah waxed mighty  and married fourteen wives  and begat twenty and two sons  and sixteen daughters   
   and the rest of the acts of abijah  and his ways  and his sayings   are  written in the story of the prophet iddo   
  chronicles    
   so abijah slept with his fathers  and they buried him in the city of david  and asa his son reigned in his stead  in his days the land was quiet ten years   
  and asa did  that which was  good and right in the eyes of the lord his god   
  for he took away the altars of the strange  gods   and the high places  and brake down the images  and cut down the groves   
  and commanded judah to seek the lord god of their fathers  and to do the law and the commandment   
  also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places and the images  and the kingdom was quiet before him   
  and he built fenced cities in judah  for the land had rest  and he had no war in those years  because the lord had given him rest   
  therefore he said unto judah  let us build these cities  and make about  them  walls  and towers  gates  and bars   while  the land  is  yet before us  because we have sought the lord our god  we have sought  him   and he hath given us rest on every side  so they built and prospered   
  and asa had an army  of men  that bare targets and spears  out of judah three hundred thousand  and out of benjamin  that bare shields and drew bows  two hundred and fourscore thousand  all these  were  mighty men of valour   
   and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand  and three hundred chariots  and came unto mareshah   
   then asa went out against him  and they set the battle in array in the valley of zephathah at mareshah   
   and asa cried unto the lord his god  and said  lord   it is  nothing with thee to help  whether with many  or with them that have no power  help us  o lord our god  for we rest on thee  and in thy name we go against this multitude  o lord  thou  art  our god  let not man prevail against thee   
   so the lord smote the ethiopians before asa  and before judah  and the ethiopians fled   
   and asa and the people that  were  with him pursued them unto gerar  and the ethiopians were overthrown  that they could not recover themselves  for they were destroyed before the lord  and before his host  and they carried away very much spoil   
   and they smote all the cities round about gerar  for the fear of the lord came upon them  and they spoiled all the cities  for there was exceeding much spoil in them   
   they smote also the tents of cattle  and carried away sheep and camels in abundance  and returned to jerusalem   
  chronicles    
   and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded   
  and he went out to meet asa  and said unto him  hear ye me  asa  and all judah and benjamin  the lord  is  with you  while ye be with him  and if ye seek him  he will be found of you  but if ye forsake him  he will forsake you   
  now for a long season israel  hath been  without the true god  and without a teaching priest  and without law   
  but when they in their trouble did turn unto the lord god of israel  and sought him  he was found of them   
  and in those times  there was  no peace to him that went out  nor to him that came in  but great vexations  were  upon all the inhabitants of the countries   
  and nation was destroyed of nation  and city of city  for god did vex them with all adversity   
  be ye strong therefore  and let not your hands be weak  for your work shall be rewarded   
   and when asa heard these words  and the prophecy of oded the prophet  he took courage  and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of judah and benjamin  and out of the cities which he had taken from mount ephraim  and renewed the altar of the lord  that  was  before the porch of the lord   
  and he gathered all judah and benjamin  and the strangers with them out of ephraim and manasseh  and out of simeon  for they fell to him out of israel in abundance  when they saw that the lord his god  was  with him   
   so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third month  in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa   
   and they offered unto the lord the same time  of the spoil  which  they had brought  seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep   
   and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul   
   that whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death  whether small or great  whether man or woman   
   and they sware unto the lord with a loud voice  and with shouting  and with trumpets  and with cornets   
   and all judah rejoiced at the oath  for they had sworn with all their heart  and sought him with their whole desire  and he was found of them  and the lord gave them rest round about   
   and also  concerning  maachah the mother of asa the king  he removed her from  being  queen  because she had made an idol in a grove  and asa cut down her idol  and stamped  it   and burnt  it  at the brook kidron   
   but the high places were not taken away out of israel  nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all his days   
   and he brought into the house of god the things that his father had dedicated  and that he himself had dedicated  silver  and gold  and vessels   
   and there was no  more  war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa   
  chronicles    
   in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel came up against judah  and built ramah  to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah   
  then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the lord and of the king s house  and sent to benhadad king of syria  that dwelt at damascus  saying   
   there is  a league between me and thee  as  there was  between my father and thy father  behold  i have sent thee silver and gold  go  break thy league with baasha king of israel  that he may depart from me   
  and benhadad hearkened unto king asa  and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel  and they smote ijon  and dan  and abelmaim  and all the store cities of naphtali   
  and it came to pass  when baasha heard  it   that he left off building of ramah  and let his work cease   
  then asa the king took all judah  and they carried away the stones of ramah  and the timber thereof  wherewith baasha was building  and he built therewith geba and mizpah   
   and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah  and said unto him  because thou hast relied on the king of syria  and not relied on the lord thy god  therefore is the host of the king of syria escaped out of thine hand   
  were not the ethiopians and the lubims a huge host  with very many chariots and horsemen  yet  because thou didst rely on the lord  he delivered them into thine hand   
  for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth  to shew himself strong in the behalf of  them  whose heart  is  perfect toward him  herein thou hast done foolishly  therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars   
   then asa was wroth with the seer  and put him in a prison house  for  he was  in a rage with him because of this  thing   and asa oppressed  some  of the people the same time   
   and  behold  the acts of asa  first and last  lo  they  are  written in the book of the kings of judah and israel   
   and asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet  until his disease  was  exceeding  great   yet in his disease he sought not to the lord  but to the physicians   
   and asa slept with his fathers  and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign   
   and they buried him in his own sepulchres  which he had made for himself in the city of david  and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds  of spices  prepared by the apothecaries  art  and they made a very great burning for him   
  chronicles    
   and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead  and strengthened himself against israel   
  and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of judah  and set garrisons in the land of judah  and in the cities of ephraim  which asa his father had taken   
  and the lord was with jehoshaphat  because he walked in the first ways of his father david  and sought not unto baalim   
  but sought to the  lord  god of his father  and walked in his commandments  and not after the doings of israel   
  therefore the lord stablished the kingdom in his hand  and all judah brought to jehoshaphat presents  and he had riches and honour in abundance   
  and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord  moreover he took away the high places and groves out of judah   
  also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes   even  to benhail  and to obadiah  and to zechariah  and to nethaneel  and to michaiah  to teach in the cities of judah   
  and with them  he sent  levites   even  shemaiah  and nethaniah  and zebadiah  and asahel  and shemiramoth  and jehonathan  and adonijah  and tobijah  and tobadonijah  levites  and with them elishama and jehoram  priests   
  and they taught in judah  and  had  the book of the law of the lord with them  and went about throughout all the cities of judah  and taught the people   
    and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that  were  round about judah  so that they made no war against jehoshaphat   
   also  some  of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents  and tribute silver  and the arabians brought him flocks  seven thousand and seven hundred rams  and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats   
   and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly  and he built in judah castles  and cities of store   
   and he had much business in the cities of judah  and the men of war  mighty men of valour   were  in jerusalem   
   and these  are  the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers  of judah  the captains of thousands  adnah the chief  and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand   
   and next to him  was  jehohanan the captain  and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand   
   and next him  was  amasiah the son of zichri  who willingly offered himself unto the lord  and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour   
   and of benjamin  eliada a mighty man of valour  and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand   
   and next him  was  jehozabad  and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war   
   these waited on the king  beside  those  whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all judah   
  chronicles    
   now jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance  and joined affinity with ahab   
  and after  certain  years he went down to ahab to samaria  and ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance  and for the people that  he had  with him  and persuaded him to go up  with him  to ramothgilead   
  and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah  wilt thou go with me to ramothgilead  and he answered him  i  am  as thou  art   and my people as thy people  and  we will be  with thee in the war   
   and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel  enquire  i pray thee  at the word of the lord to day   
  therefore the king of israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men  and said unto them  shall we go to ramothgilead to battle  or shall i forbear  and they said  go up  for god will deliver  it  into the king s hand   
  but jehoshaphat said   is there  not here a prophet of the lord besides  that we might enquire of him   
  and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat   there is  yet one man  by whom we may enquire of the lord  but i hate him  for he never prophesied good unto me  but always evil  the same  is  micaiah the son of imla  and jehoshaphat said  let not the king say so   
  and the king of israel called for one  of his  officers  and said  fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla   
  and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either of them on his throne  clothed in  their  robes  and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of samaria  and all the prophets prophesied before them   
   and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horns of iron  and said  thus saith the lord  with these thou shalt push syria until they be consumed   
   and all the prophets prophesied so  saying  go up to ramothgilead  and prosper  for the lord shall deliver  it  into the hand of the king   
   and the messenger that went to call micaiah spake to him  saying  behold  the words of the prophets  declare  good to the king with one assent  let thy word therefore  i pray thee  be like one of theirs  and speak thou good   
   and micaiah said   as  the lord liveth  even what my god saith  that will i speak   
   and when he was come to the king  the king said unto him  micaiah  shall we go to ramothgilead to battle  or shall i forbear  and he said  go ye up  and prosper  and they shall be delivered into your hand   
   and the king said to him  how many times shall i adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the lord   
   then he said  i did see all israel scattered upon the mountains  as sheep that have no shepherd  and the lord said  these have no master  let them return  therefore  every man to his house in peace   
   and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat  did i not tell thee  that  he would not prophesy good unto me  but evil   
   again he said  therefore hear the word of the lord  i saw the lord sitting upon his throne  and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and  on  his left   
   and the lord said  who shall entice ahab king of israel  that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead  and one spake saying after this manner  and another saying after that manner   
   then there came out a spirit  and stood before the lord  and said  i will entice him  and the lord said unto him  wherewith   
   and he said  i will go out  and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets  and  the lord  said  thou shalt entice  him   and thou shalt also prevail  go out  and do  even  so   
   now therefore  behold  the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets  and the lord hath spoken evil against thee   
   then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near  and smote micaiah upon the cheek  and said  which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee   
   and micaiah said  behold  thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself   
   then the king of israel said  take ye micaiah  and carry him back to amon the governor of the city  and to joash the king s son   
   and say  thus saith the king  put this  fellow  in the prison  and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction  until i return in peace   
   and micaiah said  if thou certainly return in peace   then  hath not the lord spoken by me  and he said  hearken  all ye people   
    so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead   
   and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat  i will disguise myself  and will go to the battle  but put thou on thy robes  so the king of israel disguised himself  and they went to the battle   
   now the king of syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that  were  with him  saying  fight ye not with small or great  save only with the king of israel   
   and it came to pass  when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat  that they said  it  is  the king of israel  therefore they compassed about him to fight  but jehoshaphat cried out  and the lord helped him  and god moved them  to depart  from him   
   for it came to pass  that  when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel  they turned back again from pursuing him   
   and a  certain  man drew a bow at a venture  and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness  therefore he said to his chariot man  turn thine hand  that thou mayest carry me out of the host  for i am wounded   
   and the battle increased that day  howbeit the king of israel stayed  himself  up in  his  chariot against the syrians until the even  and about the time of the sun going down he died   
  chronicles    
   and jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peace to jerusalem   
  and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him  and said to king jehoshaphat  shouldest thou help the ungodly  and love them that hate the lord  therefore  is  wrath upon thee from before the lord   
  nevertheless there are good things found in thee  in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land  and hast prepared thine heart to seek god   
  and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem  and he went out again through the people from beersheba to mount ephraim  and brought them back unto the lord god of their fathers   
   and he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of judah  city by city   
  and said to the judges  take heed what ye do  for ye judge not for man  but for the lord  who  is  with you in the judgment   
  wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you  take heed and do  it   for  there is  no iniquity with the lord our god  nor respect of persons  nor taking of gifts   
  moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites  and  of  the priests  and of the chief of the fathers of israel  for the judgment of the lord  and for controversies  when they returned to jerusalem   
  and he charged them  saying  thus shall ye do in the fear of the lord  faithfully  and with a perfect heart   
   and what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities  between blood and blood  between law and commandment  statutes and judgments  ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the lord  and  so  wrath come upon you  and upon your brethren  this do  and ye shall not trespass   
   and  behold  amariah the chief priest  is  over you in all matters of the lord  and zebadiah the son of ishmael  the ruler of the house of judah  for all the king s matters  also the levites  shall be  officers before you  deal courageously  and the lord shall be with the good   
  chronicles    
   it came to pass after this also   that  the children of moab  and the children of ammon  and with them  other  beside the ammonites  came against jehoshaphat to battle   
  then there came some that told jehoshaphat  saying  there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria  and  behold  they  be  in hazazontamar  which  is  engedi   
  and jehoshaphat feared  and set himself to seek the lord  and proclaimed a fast throughout all judah   
  and judah gathered themselves together  to ask  help  of the lord  even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord   
  and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem  in the house of the lord  before the new court   
  and said  o lord god of our fathers   art  not thou god in heaven  and rulest  not  thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen  and in thine hand  is there not  power and might  so that none is able to withstand thee   
   art  not thou our god   who  didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel  and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend for ever   
  and they dwelt therein  and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name  saying   
  if   when  evil cometh upon us   as  the sword  judgment  or pestilence  or famine  we stand before this house  and in thy presence   for thy name  is  in this house   and cry unto thee in our affliction  then thou wilt hear and help   
   and now  behold  the children of ammon and moab and mount seir  whom thou wouldest not let israel invade  when they came out of the land of egypt  but they turned from them  and destroyed them not   
   behold   i say  how  they reward us  to come to cast us out of thy possession  which thou hast given us to inherit   
   o our god  wilt thou not judge them  for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us  neither know we what to do  but our eyes  are  upon thee   
   and all judah stood before the lord  with their little ones  their wives  and their children   
    then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah  the son of benaiah  the son of jeiel  the son of mattaniah  a levite of the sons of asaph  came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation   
   and he said  hearken ye  all judah  and ye inhabitants of jerusalem  and thou king jehoshaphat  thus saith the lord unto you  be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude  for the battle  is  not yours  but god s   
   to morrow go ye down against them  behold  they come up by the cliff of ziz  and ye shall find them at the end of the brook  before the wilderness of jeruel   
   ye shall not  need  to fight in this  battle   set yourselves  stand ye  still   and see the salvation of the lord with you  o judah and jerusalem  fear not  nor be dismayed  to morrow go out against them  for the lord  will be  with you   
   and jehoshaphat bowed his head with  his  face to the ground  and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord  worshipping the lord   
   and the levites  of the children of the kohathites  and of the children of the korhites  stood up to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice on high   
    and they rose early in the morning  and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa  and as they went forth  jehoshaphat stood and said  hear me  o judah  and ye inhabitants of jerusalem  believe in the lord your god  so shall ye be established  believe his prophets  so shall ye prosper   
   and when he had consulted with the people  he appointed singers unto the lord  and that should praise the beauty of holiness  as they went out before the army  and to say  praise the lord  for his mercy  endureth  for ever   
   and when they began to sing and to praise  the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon  moab  and mount seir  which were come against judah  and they were smitten   
   for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount seir  utterly to slay and destroy  them   and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir  every one helped to destroy another   
   and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness  they looked unto the multitude  and  behold  they  were  dead bodies fallen to the earth  and none escaped   
   and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them  they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies  and precious jewels  which they stripped off for themselves  more than they could carry away  and they were three days in gathering of the spoil  it was so much   
   and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of berachah  for there they blessed the lord  therefore the name of the same place was called  the valley of berachah  unto this day   
   then they returned  every man of judah and jerusalem  and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them  to go again to jerusalem with joy  for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies   
   and they came to jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the lord   
   and the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of  those  countries  when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemies of israel   
   so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet  for his god gave him rest round about   
    and jehoshaphat reigned over judah   he was  thirty and five years old when he began to reign  and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  azubah the daughter of shilhi   
   and he walked in the way of asa his father  and departed not from it  doing  that which was  right in the sight of the lord   
   howbeit the high places were not taken away  for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the god of their fathers   
   now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat  first and last  behold  they  are  written in the book of jehu the son of hanani  who  is  mentioned in the book of the kings of israel   
   and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel  who did very wickedly   
   and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to tarshish  and they made the ships in eziongeber   
   then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesied against jehoshaphat  saying  because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah  the lord hath broken thy works  and the ships were broken  that they were not able to go to tarshish   
  chronicles    
   now jehoshaphat slept with his fathers  and was buried with his fathers in the city of david  and jehoram his son reigned in his stead   
  and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat  azariah  and jehiel  and zechariah  and azariah  and michael  and shephatiah  all these  were  the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel   
  and their father gave them great gifts of silver  and of gold  and of precious things  with fenced cities in judah  but the kingdom gave he to jehoram  because he  was  the firstborn   
  now when jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father  he strengthened himself  and slew all his brethren with the sword  and  divers  also of the princes of israel   
  jehoram  was  thirty and two years old when he began to reign  and he reigned eight years in jerusalem   
  and he walked in the way of the kings of israel  like as did the house of ahab  for he had the daughter of ahab to wife  and he wrought  that which was  evil in the eyes of the lord   
  howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david  because of the covenant that he had made with david  and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever   
  in his days the edomites revolted from under the dominion of judah  and made themselves a king   
  then jehoram went forth with his princes  and all his chariots with him  and he rose up by night  and smote the edomites which compassed him in  and the captains of the chariots   
   so the edomites revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day  the same time  also  did libnah revolt from under his hand  because he had forsaken the lord god of his fathers   
   moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah  and caused the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit fornication  and compelled judah  thereto    
    and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet  saying  thus saith the lord god of david thy father  because thou hast not walked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father  nor in the ways of asa king of judah   
   but hast walked in the way of the kings of israel  and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to go a whoring  like to the whoredoms of the house of ahab  and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father s house   which were  better than thyself   
   behold  with a great plague will the lord smite thy people  and thy children  and thy wives  and all thy goods   
   and thou  shalt have  great sickness by disease of thy bowels  until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day   
   moreover the lord stirred up against jehoram the spirit of the philistines  and of the arabians  that  were  near the ethiopians   
   and they came up into judah  and brake into it  and carried away all the substance that was found in the king s house  and his sons also  and his wives  so that there was never a son left him  save jehoahaz  the youngest of his sons   
   and after all this the lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease   
   and it came to pass  that in process of time  after the end of two years  his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness  so he died of sore diseases  and his people made no burning for him  like the burning of his fathers   
   thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign  and he reigned in jerusalem eight years  and departed without being desired  howbeit they buried him in the city of david  but not in the sepulchres of the kings   
  chronicles    
   and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead  for the band of men that came with the arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest  so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reigned   
  forty and two years old  was  ahaziah when he began to reign  and he reigned one year in jerusalem  his mother s name also  was  athaliah the daughter of omri   
  he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab  for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly   
  wherefore he did evil in the sight of the lord like the house of ahab  for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction   
  he walked also after their counsel  and went with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramothgilead  and the syrians smote joram   
  and he returned to be healed in jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at ramah  when he fought with hazael king of syria  and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel  because he was sick   
  and the destruction of ahaziah was of god by coming to joram  for when he was come  he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi  whom the lord had anointed to cut off the house of ahab   
  and it came to pass  that  when jehu was executing judgment upon the house of ahab  and found the princes of judah  and the sons of the brethren of ahaziah  that ministered to ahaziah  he slew them   
  and he sought ahaziah  and they caught him   for he was hid in samaria   and brought him to jehu  and when they had slain him  they buried him  because  said they  he  is  the son of jehoshaphat  who sought the lord with all his heart  so the house of ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom   
    but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead  she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of judah   
   but jehoshabeath  the daughter of the king  took joash the son of ahaziah  and stole him from among the king s sons that were slain  and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber  so jehoshabeath  the daughter of king jehoram  the wife of jehoiada the priest   for she was the sister of ahaziah   hid him from athaliah  so that she slew him not   
   and he was with them hid in the house of god six years  and athaliah reigned over the land   
  chronicles    
   and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself  and took the captains of hundreds  azariah the son of jeroham  and ishmael the son of jehohanan  and azariah the son of obed  and maaseiah the son of adaiah  and elishaphat the son of zichri  into covenant with him   
  and they went about in judah  and gathered the levites out of all the cities of judah  and the chief of the fathers of israel  and they came to jerusalem   
  and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of god  and he said unto them  behold  the king s son shall reign  as the lord hath said of the sons of david   
  this  is  the thing that ye shall do  a third part of you entering on the sabbath  of the priests and of the levites   shall be  porters of the doors   
  and a third part  shall be  at the king s house  and a third part at the gate of the foundation  and all the people  shall be  in the courts of the house of the lord   
  but let none come into the house of the lord  save the priests  and they that minister of the levites  they shall go in  for they  are  holy  but all the people shall keep the watch of the lord   
  and the levites shall compass the king round about  every man with his weapons in his hand  and whosoever  else  cometh into the house  he shall be put to death  but be ye with the king when he cometh in  and when he goeth out   
  so the levites and all judah did according to all things that jehoiada the priest had commanded  and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath  with them that were to go  out  on the sabbath  for jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses   
  moreover jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears  and bucklers  and shields  that  had been  king david s  which  were  in the house of god   
   and he set all the people  every man having his weapon in his hand  from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple  along by the altar and the temple  by the king round about   
   then they brought out the king s son  and put upon him the crown  and  gave him  the testimony  and made him king  and jehoiada and his sons anointed him  and said  god save the king   
    now when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king  she came to the people into the house of the lord   
   and she looked  and  behold  the king stood at his pillar at the entering in  and the princes and the trumpets by the king  and all the people of the land rejoiced  and sounded with trumpets  also the singers with instruments of musick  and such as taught to sing praise  then athaliah rent her clothes  and said  treason  treason   
   then jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host  and said unto them  have her forth of the ranges  and whoso followeth her  let him be slain with the sword  for the priest said  slay her not in the house of the lord   
   so they laid hands on her  and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king s house  they slew her there   
   and jehoiada made a covenant between him  and between all the people  and between the king  that they should be the lord s people   
   then all the people went to the house of baal  and brake it down  and brake his altars and his images in pieces  and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars   
   also jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the lord by the hand of the priests the levites  whom david had distributed in the house of the lord  to offer the burnt offerings of the lord  as  it is  written in the law of moses  with rejoicing and with singing   as it was ordained  by david   
   and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the lord  that none  which was  unclean in any thing should enter in   
   and he took the captains of hundreds  and the nobles  and the governors of the people  and all the people of the land  and brought down the king from the house of the lord  and they came through the high gate into the king s house  and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom   
   and all the people of the land rejoiced  and the city was quiet  after that they had slain athaliah with the sword   
  chronicles    
   joash  was  seven years old when he began to reign  and he reigned forty years in jerusalem  his mother s name also  was  zibiah of beersheba   
  and joash did  that which was  right in the sight of the lord all the days of jehoiada the priest   
  and jehoiada took for him two wives  and he begat sons and daughters   
  and it came to pass after this   that  joash was minded to repair the house of the lord   
  and he gathered together the priests and the levites  and said to them  go out unto the cities of judah  and gather of all israel money to repair the house of your god from year to year  and see that ye hasten the matter  howbeit the levites hastened  it  not   
  and the king called for jehoiada the chief  and said unto him  why hast thou not required of the levites to bring in out of judah and out of jerusalem the collection   according to the commandment  of moses the servant of the lord  and of the congregation of israel  for the tabernacle of witness   
  for the sons of athaliah  that wicked woman  had broken up the house of god  and also all the dedicated things of the house of the lord did they bestow upon baalim   
  and at the king s commandment they made a chest  and set it without at the gate of the house of the lord   
  and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem  to bring in to the lord the collection  that  moses the servant of god  laid  upon israel in the wilderness   
   and all the princes and all the people rejoiced  and brought in  and cast into the chest  until they had made an end   
   now it came to pass  that at what time the chest was brought unto the king s office by the hand of the levites  and when they saw that  there was  much money  the king s scribe and the high priest s officer came and emptied the chest  and took it  and carried it to his place again  thus they did day by day  and gathered money in abundance   
   and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the lord  and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the lord  and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the lord   
   so the workmen wrought  and the work was perfected by them  and they set the house of god in his state  and strengthened it   
   and when they had finished  it   they brought the rest of the money before the king and jehoiada  whereof were made vessels for the house of the lord   even  vessels to minister  and to offer  withal   and spoons  and vessels of gold and silver  and they offered burnt offerings in the house of the lord continually all the days of jehoiada   
    but jehoiada waxed old  and was full of days when he died  an hundred and thirty years old  was he  when he died   
   and they buried him in the city of david among the kings  because he had done good in israel  both toward god  and toward his house   
   now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah  and made obeisance to the king  then the king hearkened unto them   
   and they left the house of the lord god of their fathers  and served groves and idols  and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for this their trespass   
   yet he sent prophets to them  to bring them again unto the lord  and they testified against them  but they would not give ear   
   and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest  which stood above the people  and said unto them  thus saith god  why transgress ye the commandments of the lord  that ye cannot prosper  because ye have forsaken the lord  he hath also forsaken you   
   and they conspired against him  and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord   
   thus joash the king remembered not the kindness which jehoiada his father had done to him  but slew his son  and when he died  he said  the lord look upon  it   and require  it    
   and it came to pass at the end of the year   that  the host of syria came up against him  and they came to judah and jerusalem  and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people  and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus   
   for the army of the syrians came with a small company of men  and the lord delivered a very great host into their hand  because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers  so they executed judgment against joash   
   and when they were departed from him   for they left him in great diseases   his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of jehoiada the priest  and slew him on his bed  and he died  and they buried him in the city of david  but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings   
   and these are they that conspired against him  zabad the son of shimeath an ammonitess  and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess   
   now  concerning  his sons  and the greatness of the burdens  laid  upon him  and the repairing of the house of god  behold  they  are  written in the story of the book of the kings  and amaziah his son reigned in his stead   
  chronicles    
   amaziah  was  twenty and five years old  when  he began to reign  and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  jehoaddan of jerusalem   
  and he did  that which was  right in the sight of the lord  but not with a perfect heart   
  now it came to pass  when the kingdom was established to him  that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father   
  but he slew not their children  but  did  as  it is  written in the law in the book of moses  where the lord commanded  saying  the fathers shall not die for the children  neither shall the children die for the fathers  but every man shall die for his own sin   
  moreover amaziah gathered judah together  and made them captains over thousands  and captains over hundreds  according to the houses of  their  fathers  throughout all judah and benjamin  and he numbered them from twenty years old and above  and found them three hundred thousand choice  men  able  to go forth to war  that could handle spear and shield   
  he hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of israel for an hundred talents of silver   
  but there came a man of god to him  saying  o king  let not the army of israel go with thee  for the lord  is  not with israel   to wit  with  all the children of ephraim   
  but if thou wilt go  do  it   be strong for the battle  god shall make thee fall before the enemy  for god hath power to help  and to cast down   
  and amaziah said to the man of god  but what shall we do for the hundred talents which i have given to the army of israel  and the man of god answered  the lord is able to give thee much more than this   
   then amaziah separated them   to wit   the army that was come to him out of ephraim  to go home again  wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against judah  and they returned home in great anger   
   and amaziah strengthened himself  and led forth his people  and went to the valley of salt  and smote of the children of seir ten thousand   
   and  other  ten thousand  left  alive did the children of judah carry away captive  and brought them unto the top of the rock  and cast them down from the top of the rock  that they all were broken in pieces   
   but the soldiers of the army which amaziah sent back  that they should not go with him to battle  fell upon the cities of judah  from samaria even unto bethhoron  and smote three thousand of them  and took much spoil   
    now it came to pass  after that amaziah was come from the slaughter of the edomites  that he brought the gods of the children of seir  and set them up  to be  his gods  and bowed down himself before them  and burned incense unto them   
   wherefore the anger of the lord was kindled against amaziah  and he sent unto him a prophet  which said unto him  why hast thou sought after the gods of the people  which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand   
   and it came to pass  as he talked with him  that  the king  said unto him  art thou made of the king s counsel  forbear  why shouldest thou be smitten  then the prophet forbare  and said  i know that god hath determined to destroy thee  because thou hast done this  and hast not hearkened unto my counsel   
    then amaziah king of judah took advice  and sent to joash  the son of jehoahaz  the son of jehu  king of israel  saying  come  let us see one another in the face   
   and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah  saying  the thistle that  was  in lebanon sent to the cedar that  was  in lebanon  saying  give thy daughter to my son to wife  and there passed by a wild beast that  was  in lebanon  and trode down the thistle   
   thou sayest  lo  thou hast smitten the edomites  and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast  abide now at home  why shouldest thou meddle to  thine  hurt  that thou shouldest fall   even  thou  and judah with thee   
   but amaziah would not hear  for it  came  of god  that he might deliver them into the hand  of their enemies   because they sought after the gods of edom   
   so joash the king of israel went up  and they saw one another in the face   both  he and amaziah king of judah  at bethshemesh  which  belongeth  to judah   
   and judah was put to the worse before israel  and they fled every man to his tent   
   and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah  the son of joash  the son of jehoahaz  at bethshemesh  and brought him to jerusalem  and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim to the corner gate  four hundred cubits   
   and  he took  all the gold and the silver  and all the vessels that were found in the house of god with obededom  and the treasures of the king s house  the hostages also  and returned to samaria   
   and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years   
   now the rest of the acts of amaziah  first and last  behold   are  they not written in the book of the kings of judah and israel   
   now after the time that amaziah did turn away from following the lord they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem  and he fled to lachish  but they sent to lachish after him  and slew him there   
   and they brought him upon horses  and buried him with his fathers in the city of judah   
  chronicles    
   then all the people of judah took uzziah  who  was  sixteen years old  and made him king in the room of his father amaziah   
  he built eloth  and restored it to judah  after that the king slept with his fathers   
  sixteen years old  was  uzziah when he began to reign  and he reigned fifty and two years in jerusalem  his mother s name also  was  jecoliah of jerusalem   
  and he did  that which was  right in the sight of the lord  according to all that his father amaziah did   
  and he sought god in the days of zechariah  who had understanding in the visions of god  and as long as he sought the lord  god made him to prosper   
  and he went forth and warred against the philistines  and brake down the wall of gath  and the wall of jabneh  and the wall of ashdod  and built cities about ashdod  and among the philistines   
  and god helped him against the philistines  and against the arabians that dwelt in gurbaal  and the mehunims   
  and the ammonites gave gifts to uzziah  and his name spread abroad  even  to the entering in of egypt  for he strengthened  himself  exceedingly   
  moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate  and at the valley gate  and at the turning  of the wall   and fortified them   
   also he built towers in the desert  and digged many wells  for he had much cattle  both in the low country  and in the plains  husbandmen  also   and vine dressers in the mountains  and in carmel  for he loved husbandry   
   moreover uzziah had an host of fighting men  that went out to war by bands  according to the number of their account by the hand of jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler  under the hand of hananiah   one  of the king s captains   
   the whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour  were  two thousand and six hundred   
   and under their hand  was  an army  three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred  that made war with mighty power  to help the king against the enemy   
   and uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields  and spears  and helmets  and habergeons  and bows  and slings  to cast  stones   
   and he made in jerusalem engines  invented by cunning men  to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks  to shoot arrows and great stones withal  and his name spread far abroad  for he was marvellously helped  till he was strong   
    but when he was strong  his heart was lifted up to  his  destruction  for he transgressed against the lord his god  and went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense   
   and azariah the priest went in after him  and with him fourscore priests of the lord   that were  valiant men   
   and they withstood uzziah the king  and said unto him   it appertaineth  not unto thee  uzziah  to burn incense unto the lord  but to the priests the sons of aaron  that are consecrated to burn incense  go out of the sanctuary  for thou hast trespassed  neither  shall it be  for thine honour from the lord god   
   then uzziah was wroth  and  had  a censer in his hand to burn incense  and while he was wroth with the priests  the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the lord  from beside the incense altar   
   and azariah the chief priest  and all the priests  looked upon him  and  behold  he  was  leprous in his forehead  and they thrust him out from thence  yea  himself hasted also to go out  because the lord had smitten him   
   and uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death  and dwelt in a several house   being  a leper  for he was cut off from the house of the lord  and jotham his son  was  over the king s house  judging the people of the land   
   now the rest of the acts of uzziah  first and last  did isaiah the prophet  the son of amoz  write   
   so uzziah slept with his fathers  and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which  belonged  to the kings  for they said  he  is  a leper  and jotham his son reigned in his stead   
  chronicles    
   jotham  was  twenty and five years old when he began to reign  and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem  his mother s name also  was  jerushah  the daughter of zadok   
  and he did  that which was  right in the sight of the lord  according to all that his father uzziah did  howbeit he entered not into the temple of the lord  and the people did yet corruptly   
  he built the high gate of the house of the lord  and on the wall of ophel he built much   
  moreover he built cities in the mountains of judah  and in the forests he built castles and towers   
  he fought also with the king of the ammonites  and prevailed against them  and the children of ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver  and ten thousand measures of wheat  and ten thousand of barley  so much did the children of ammon pay unto him  both the second year  and the third   
  so jotham became mighty  because he prepared his ways before the lord his god   
  now the rest of the acts of jotham  and all his wars  and his ways  lo  they  are  written in the book of the kings of israel and judah   
  he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign  and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem   
  and jotham slept with his fathers  and they buried him in the city of david  and ahaz his son reigned in his stead   
  chronicles    
   ahaz  was  twenty years old when he began to reign  and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem  but he did not  that which was  right in the sight of the lord  like david his father   
  for he walked in the ways of the kings of israel  and made also molten images for baalim   
  moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom  and burnt his children in the fire  after the abominations of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel   
  he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places  and on the hills  and under every green tree   
  wherefore the lord his god delivered him into the hand of the king of syria  and they smote him  and carried away a great multitude of them captives  and brought  them  to damascus  and he was also delivered into the hand of the king of israel  who smote him with a great slaughter   
   for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day   which were  all valiant men  because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers   
  and zichri  a mighty man of ephraim  slew maaseiah the king s son  and azrikam the governor of the house  and elkanah  that was  next to the king   
  and the children of israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand  women  sons  and daughters  and took also away much spoil from them  and brought the spoil to samaria   
  but a prophet of the lord was there  whose name  was  oded  and he went out before the host that came to samaria  and said unto them  behold  because the lord god of your fathers was wroth with judah  he hath delivered them into your hand  and ye have slain them in a rage  that  reacheth up unto heaven   
   and now ye purpose to keep under the children of judah and jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you   but are there  not with you  even with you  sins against the lord your god   
   now hear me therefore  and deliver the captives again  which ye have taken captive of your brethren  for the fierce wrath of the lord  is  upon you   
   then certain of the heads of the children of ephraim  azariah the son of johanan  berechiah the son of meshillemoth  and jehizkiah the son of shallum  and amasa the son of hadlai  stood up against them that came from the war   
   and said unto them  ye shall not bring in the captives hither  for whereas we have offended against the lord  already   ye intend to add  more  to our sins and to our trespass  for our trespass is great  and  there is  fierce wrath against israel   
   so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation   
   and the men which were expressed by name rose up  and took the captives  and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them  and arrayed them  and shod them  and gave them to eat and to drink  and anointed them  and carried all the feeble of them upon asses  and brought them to jericho  the city of palm trees  to their brethren  then they returned to samaria   
    at that time did king ahaz send unto the kings of assyria to help him   
   for again the edomites had come and smitten judah  and carried away captives   
   the philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country  and of the south of judah  and had taken bethshemesh  and ajalon  and gederoth  and shocho with the villages thereof  and timnah with the villages thereof  gimzo also and the villages thereof  and they dwelt there   
   for the lord brought judah low because of ahaz king of israel  for he made judah naked  and transgressed sore against the lord   
   and tilgathpilneser king of assyria came unto him  and distressed him  but strengthened him not   
   for ahaz took away a portion  out  of the house of the lord  and  out  of the house of the king  and of the princes  and gave  it  unto the king of assyria  but he helped him not   
   and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the lord  this  is that  king ahaz   
   for he sacrificed unto the gods of damascus  which smote him  and he said  because the gods of the kings of syria help them   therefore  will i sacrifice to them  that they may help me  but they were the ruin of him  and of all israel   
   and ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of god  and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god  and shut up the doors of the house of the lord  and he made him altars in every corner of jerusalem   
   and in every several city of judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods  and provoked to anger the lord god of his fathers   
   now the rest of his acts and of all his ways  first and last  behold  they  are  written in the book of the kings of judah and israel   
   and ahaz slept with his fathers  and they buried him in the city   even  in jerusalem  but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of israel  and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead   
  chronicles    
   hezekiah began to reign  when he was  five and twenty years old  and he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  abijah  the daughter of zechariah   
  and he did  that which was  right in the sight of the lord  according to all that david his father had done   
  he in the first year of his reign  in the first month  opened the doors of the house of the lord  and repaired them   
  and he brought in the priests and the levites  and gathered them together into the east street   
  and said unto them  hear me  ye levites  sanctify now yourselves  and sanctify the house of the lord god of your fathers  and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy  place    
  for our fathers have trespassed  and done  that which was  evil in the eyes of the lord our god  and have forsaken him  and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the lord  and turned  their  backs   
  also they have shut up the doors of the porch  and put out the lamps  and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy  place  unto the god of israel   
  wherefore the wrath of the lord was upon judah and jerusalem  and he hath delivered them to trouble  to astonishment  and to hissing  as ye see with your eyes   
  for  lo  our fathers have fallen by the sword  and our sons and our daughters and our wives  are  in captivity for this   
   now  it is  in mine heart to make a covenant with the lord god of israel  that his fierce wrath may turn away from us   
   my sons  be not now negligent  for the lord hath chosen you to stand before him  to serve him  and that ye should minister unto him  and burn incense   
    then the levites arose  mahath the son of amasai  and joel the son of azariah  of the sons of the kohathites  and of the sons of merari  kish the son of abdi  and azariah the son of jehalelel  and of the gershonites  joah the son of zimmah  and eden the son of joah   
   and of the sons of elizaphan  shimri  and jeiel  and of the sons of asaph  zechariah  and mattaniah   
   and of the sons of heman  jehiel  and shimei  and of the sons of jeduthun  shemaiah  and uzziel   
   and they gathered their brethren  and sanctified themselves  and came  according to the commandment of the king  by the words of the lord  to cleanse the house of the lord   
   and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the lord  to cleanse  it   and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of the lord  and the levites took  it   to carry  it  out abroad into the brook kidron   
   now they began on the first  day  of the first month to sanctify  and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lord  so they sanctified the house of the lord in eight days  and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end   
   then they went in to hezekiah the king  and said  we have cleansed all the house of the lord  and the altar of burnt offering  with all the vessels thereof  and the shewbread table  with all the vessels thereof   
   moreover all the vessels  which king ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression  have we prepared and sanctified  and  behold  they  are  before the altar of the lord   
    then hezekiah the king rose early  and gathered the rulers of the city  and went up to the house of the lord   
   and they brought seven bullocks  and seven rams  and seven lambs  and seven he goats  for a sin offering for the kingdom  and for the sanctuary  and for judah  and he commanded the priests the sons of aaron to offer  them  on the altar of the lord   
   so they killed the bullocks  and the priests received the blood  and sprinkled  it  on the altar  likewise  when they had killed the rams  they sprinkled the blood upon the altar  they killed also the lambs  and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar   
   and they brought forth the he goats  for  the sin offering before the king and the congregation  and they laid their hands upon them   
   and the priests killed them  and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar  to make an atonement for all israel  for the king commanded  that  the burnt offering and the sin offering  should be made  for all israel   
   and he set the levites in the house of the lord with cymbals  with psalteries  and with harps  according to the commandment of david  and of gad the king s seer  and nathan the prophet  for  so was  the commandment of the lord by his prophets   
   and the levites stood with the instruments of david  and the priests with the trumpets   
   and hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar  and when the burnt offering began  the song of the lord began  also  with the trumpets  and with the instruments  ordained  by david king of israel   
   and all the congregation worshipped  and the singers sang  and the trumpeters sounded   and  all  this continued  until the burnt offering was finished   
   and when they had made an end of offering  the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves  and worshipped   
   moreover hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the levites to sing praise unto the lord with the words of david  and of asaph the seer  and they sang praises with gladness  and they bowed their heads and worshipped   
   then hezekiah answered and said  now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the lord  come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the lord  and the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings  and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings   
   and the number of the burnt offerings  which the congregation brought  was threescore and ten bullocks  an hundred rams   and  two hundred lambs  all these  were  for a burnt offering to the lord   
   and the consecrated things  were  six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep   
   but the priests were too few  so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings  wherefore their brethren the levites did help them  till the work was ended  and until the  other  priests had sanctified themselves  for the levites  were  more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests   
   and also the burnt offerings  were  in abundance  with the fat of the peace offerings  and the drink offerings for  every  burnt offering  so the service of the house of the lord was set in order   
   and hezekiah rejoiced  and all the people  that god had prepared the people  for the thing was  done  suddenly   
  chronicles    
   and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah  and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh  that they should come to the house of the lord at jerusalem  to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel   
  for the king had taken counsel  and his princes  and all the congregation in jerusalem  to keep the passover in the second month   
  for they could not keep it at that time  because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently  neither had the people gathered themselves together to jerusalem   
  and the thing pleased the king and all the congregation   
  so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all israel  from beersheba even to dan  that they should come to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem  for they had not done  it  of a long  time in such sort  as it was written   
  so the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all israel and judah  and according to the commandment of the king  saying  ye children of israel  turn again unto the lord god of abraham  isaac  and israel  and he will return to the remnant of you  that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of assyria   
  and be not ye like your fathers  and like your brethren  which trespassed against the lord god of their fathers   who  therefore gave them up to desolation  as ye see   
  now be ye not stiffnecked  as your fathers  were  but  yield yourselves unto the lord  and enter into his sanctuary  which he hath sanctified for ever  and serve the lord your god  that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you   
  for if ye turn again unto the lord  your brethren and your children  shall find  compassion before them that lead them captive  so that they shall come again into this land  for the lord your god  is  gracious and merciful  and will not turn away  his  face from you  if ye return unto him   
   so the posts passed from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun  but they laughed them to scorn  and mocked them   
   nevertheless divers of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled themselves  and came to jerusalem   
   also in judah the hand of god was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes  by the word of the lord   
    and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month  a very great congregation   
   and they arose and took away the altars that  were  in jerusalem  and all the altars for incense took they away  and cast  them  into the brook kidron   
   then they killed the passover on the fourteenth  day  of the second month  and the priests and the levites were ashamed  and sanctified themselves  and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the lord   
   and they stood in their place after their manner  according to the law of moses the man of god  the priests sprinkled the blood   which they received  of the hand of the levites   
   for  there were  many in the congregation that were not sanctified  therefore the levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one  that was  not clean  to sanctify  them  unto the lord   
   for a multitude of the people   even  many of ephraim  and manasseh  issachar  and zebulun  had not cleansed themselves  yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written  but hezekiah prayed for them  saying  the good lord pardon every one  
    that  prepareth his heart to seek god  the lord god of his fathers  though  he be  not  cleansed  according to the purification of the sanctuary   
   and the lord hearkened to hezekiah  and healed the people   
    and the children of israel that were present at jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness  and the levites and the priests praised the lord day by day   singing  with loud instruments unto the lord   
   and hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the levites that taught the good knowledge of the lord  and they did eat throughout the feast seven days  offering peace offerings  and making confession to the lord god of their fathers   
   and the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days  and they kept  other  seven days with gladness   
   for hezekiah king of judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep  and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep  and a great number of priests sanctified themselves   
   and all the congregation of judah  with the priests and the levites  and all the congregation that came out of israel  and the strangers that came out of the land of israel  and that dwelt in judah  rejoiced   
   so there was great joy in jerusalem  for since the time of solomon the son of david king of israel  there was  not the like in jerusalem   
   then the priests the levites arose and blessed the people  and their voice was heard  and their prayer came  up  to his holy dwelling place   even  unto heaven   
  chronicles    
   now when all this was finished  all israel that were present went out to the cities of judah  and brake the images in pieces  and cut down the groves  and threw down the high places and the altars out of all judah and benjamin  in ephraim also and manasseh  until they had utterly destroyed them all  then all the children of israel returned  every man to his possession  into their own cities   
  and hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the levites after their courses  every man according to his service  the priests and levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings  to minister  and to give thanks  and to praise in the gates of the tents of the lord   
   he appointed  also the king s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings   to wit   for the morning and evening burnt offerings  and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths  and for the new moons  and for the set feasts  as  it is  written in the law of the lord   
  moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the levites  that they might be encouraged in the law of the lord   
  and as soon as the commandment came abroad  the children of israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn  wine  and oil  and honey  and of all the increase of the field  and the tithe of all  things  brought they in abundantly   
  and  concerning  the children of israel and judah  that dwelt in the cities of judah  they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep  and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the lord their god  and laid  them  by heaps   
  in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps  and finished  them  in the seventh month   
  and when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps  they blessed the lord  and his people israel   
  then hezekiah questioned with the priests and the levites concerning the heaps   
   and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered him  and said  since  the people  began to bring the offerings into the house of the lord  we have had enough to eat  and have left plenty  for the lord hath blessed his people  and that which is left  is  this great store   
    then hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the lord  and they prepared  them    
   and brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated  things  faithfully  over which cononiah the levite  was  ruler  and shimei his brother  was  the next   
   and jehiel  and azaziah  and nahath  and asahel  and jerimoth  and jozabad  and eliel  and ismachiah  and mahath  and benaiah   were  overseers under the hand of cononiah and shimei his brother  at the commandment of hezekiah the king  and azariah the ruler of the house of god   
   and kore the son of imnah the levite  the porter toward the east   was  over the freewill offerings of god  to distribute the oblations of the lord  and the most holy things   
   and next him  were  eden  and miniamin  and jeshua  and shemaiah  amariah  and shecaniah  in the cities of the priests  in  their  set office  to give to their brethren by courses  as well to the great as to the small   
   beside their genealogy of males  from three years old and upward   even  unto every one that entereth into the house of the lord  his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses   
   both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers  and the levites from twenty years old and upward  in their charges by their courses   
   and to the genealogy of all their little ones  their wives  and their sons  and their daughters  through all the congregation  for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness   
   also of the sons of aaron the priests   which were  in the fields of the suburbs of their cities  in every several city  the men that were expressed by name  to give portions to all the males among the priests  and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the levites   
   and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah  and wrought  that which was  good and right and truth before the lord his god   
   and in every work that he began in the service of the house of god  and in the law  and in the commandments  to seek his god  he did  it  with all his heart  and prospered   
  chronicles    
   after these things  and the establishment thereof  sennacherib king of assyria came  and entered into judah  and encamped against the fenced cities  and thought to win them for himself   
  and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come  and that he was purposed to fight against jerusalem   
  he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which  were  without the city  and they did help him   
  so there was gathered much people together  who stopped all the fountains  and the brook that ran through the midst of the land  saying  why should the kings of assyria come  and find much water   
  also he strengthened himself  and built up all the wall that was broken  and raised  it  up to the towers  and another wall without  and repaired millo  in  the city of david  and made darts and shields in abundance   
  and he set captains of war over the people  and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city  and spake comfortably to them  saying   
  be strong and courageous  be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria  nor for all the multitude that  is  with him  for  there be  more with us than with him   
  with him  is  an arm of flesh  but with us  is  the lord our god to help us  and to fight our battles  and the people rested themselves upon the words of hezekiah king of judah   
   after this did sennacherib king of assyria send his servants to jerusalem   but he  himself laid siege  against lachish  and all his power with him   unto hezekiah king of judah  and unto all judah that  were  at jerusalem  saying   
   thus saith sennacherib king of assyria  whereon do ye trust  that ye abide in the siege in jerusalem   
   doth not hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst  saying  the lord our god shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of assyria   
   hath not the same hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars  and commanded judah and jerusalem  saying  ye shall worship before one altar  and burn incense upon it   
   know ye not what i and my fathers have done unto all the people of  other  lands  were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand   
   who  was there  among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed  that could deliver his people out of mine hand  that your god should be able to deliver you out of mine hand   
   now therefore let not hezekiah deceive you  nor persuade you on this manner  neither yet believe him  for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand  and out of the hand of my fathers  how much less shall your god deliver you out of mine hand   
   and his servants spake yet  more  against the lord god  and against his servant hezekiah   
   he wrote also letters to rail on the lord god of israel  and to speak against him  saying  as the gods of the nations of  other  lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand  so shall not the god of hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand   
   then they cried with a loud voice in the jews  speech unto the people of jerusalem that  were  on the wall  to affright them  and to trouble them  that they might take the city   
   and they spake against the god of jerusalem  as against the gods of the people of the earth   which were  the work of the hands of man   
   and for this  cause  hezekiah the king  and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz  prayed and cried to heaven   
   and the lord sent an angel  which cut off all the mighty men of valour  and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of assyria  so he returned with shame of face to his own land  and when he was come into the house of his god  they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword   
   thus the lord saved hezekiah and the inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria  and from the hand of all  other   and guided them on every side   
   and many brought gifts unto the lord to jerusalem  and presents to hezekiah king of judah  so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth   
    in those days hezekiah was sick to the death  and prayed unto the lord  and he spake unto him  and he gave him a sign   
   but hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit  done  unto him  for his heart was lifted up  therefore there was wrath upon him  and upon judah and jerusalem   
   notwithstanding hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart   both  he and the inhabitants of jerusalem  so that the wrath of the lord came not upon them in the days of hezekiah   
   and hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour  and he made himself treasuries for silver  and for gold  and for precious stones  and for spices  and for shields  and for all manner of pleasant jewels   
   storehouses also for the increase of corn  and wine  and oil  and stalls for all manner of beasts  and cotes for flocks   
   moreover he provided him cities  and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance  for god had given him substance very much   
   this same hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of gihon  and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of david  and hezekiah prospered in all his works   
   howbeit in  the business of  the ambassadors of the princes of babylon  who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was  done  in the land  god left him  to try him  that he might know all  that was  in his heart   
   now the rest of the acts of hezekiah  and his goodness  behold  they  are  written in the vision of isaiah the prophet  the son of amoz   and  in the book of the kings of judah and israel   
   and hezekiah slept with his fathers  and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of david  and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem did him honour at his death  and manasseh his son reigned in his stead   
  chronicles    
   manasseh  was  twelve years old when he began to reign  and he reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem   
  but did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  like unto the abominations of the heathen  whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel   
  for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had broken down  and he reared up altars for baalim  and made groves  and worshipped all the host of heaven  and served them   
  also he built altars in the house of the lord  whereof the lord had said  in jerusalem shall my name be for ever   
  and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord   
  and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom  also he observed times  and used enchantments  and used witchcraft  and dealt with a familiar spirit  and with wizards  he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord  to provoke him to anger   
  and he set a carved image  the idol which he had made  in the house of god  of which god had said to david and to solomon his son  in this house  and in jerusalem  which i have chosen before all the tribes of israel  will i put my name for ever   
  neither will i any more remove the foot of israel from out of the land which i have appointed for your fathers  so that they will take heed to do all that i have commanded them  according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of moses   
  so manasseh made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to err   and  to do worse than the heathen  whom the lord had destroyed before the children of israel   
   and the lord spake to manasseh  and to his people  but they would not hearken   
    wherefore the lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of assyria  which took manasseh among the thorns  and bound him with fetters  and carried him to babylon   
   and when he was in affliction  he besought the lord his god  and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers   
   and prayed unto him  and he was intreated of him  and heard his supplication  and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom  then manasseh knew that the lord he  was  god   
   now after this he built a wall without the city of david  on the west side of gihon  in the valley  even to the entering in at the fish gate  and compassed about ophel  and raised it up a very great height  and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of judah   
   and he took away the strange gods  and the idol out of the house of the lord  and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the lord  and in jerusalem  and cast  them  out of the city   
   and he repaired the altar of the lord  and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings  and commanded judah to serve the lord god of israel   
   nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places   yet  unto the lord their god only   
   now the rest of the acts of manasseh  and his prayer unto his god  and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the lord god of israel  behold  they  are written  in the book of the kings of israel   
   his prayer also  and  how god  was intreated of him  and all his sin  and his trespass  and the places wherein he built high places  and set up groves and graven images  before he was humbled  behold  they  are  written among the sayings of the seers   
   so manasseh slept with his fathers  and they buried him in his own house  and amon his son reigned in his stead   
    amon  was  two and twenty years old when he began to reign  and reigned two years in jerusalem   
   but he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord  as did manasseh his father  for amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which manasseh his father had made  and served them   
   and humbled not himself before the lord  as manasseh his father had humbled himself  but amon trespassed more and more   
   and his servants conspired against him  and slew him in his own house   
   but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon  and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead   
  chronicles    
   josiah  was  eight years old when he began to reign  and he reigned in jerusalem one and thirty years   
  and he did  that which was  right in the sight of the lord  and walked in the ways of david his father  and declined  neither  to the right hand  nor to the left   
  for in the eighth year of his reign  while he was yet young  he began to seek after the god of david his father  and in the twelfth year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places  and the groves  and the carved images  and the molten images   
  and they brake down the altars of baalim in his presence  and the images  that  were  on high above them  he cut down  and the groves  and the carved images  and the molten images  he brake in pieces  and made dust  of them   and strowed  it  upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them   
  and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars  and cleansed judah and jerusalem   
  and  so did he  in the cities of manasseh  and ephraim  and simeon  even unto naphtali  with their mattocks round about   
  and when he had broken down the altars and the groves  and had beaten the graven images into powder  and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of israel  he returned to jerusalem   
   now in the eighteenth year of his reign  when he had purged the land  and the house  he sent shaphan the son of azaliah  and maaseiah the governor of the city  and joah the son of joahaz the recorder  to repair the house of the lord his god   
  and when they came to hilkiah the high priest  they delivered the money that was brought into the house of god  which the levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of manasseh and ephraim  and of all the remnant of israel  and of all judah and benjamin  and they returned to jerusalem   
   and they put  it  in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the lord  and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the lord  to repair and amend the house   
   even to the artificers and builders gave they  it   to buy hewn stone  and timber for couplings  and to floor the houses which the kings of judah had destroyed   
   and the men did the work faithfully  and the overseers of them  were  jahath and obadiah  the levites  of the sons of merari  and zechariah and meshullam  of the sons of the kohathites  to set  it  forward  and  other of  the levites  all that could skill of instruments of musick   
   also  they were  over the bearers of burdens  and  were  overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service  and of the levites  there were  scribes  and officers  and porters   
    and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the lord  hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the lord  given  by moses   
   and hilkiah answered and said to shaphan the scribe  i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord  and hilkiah delivered the book to shaphan   
   and shaphan carried the book to the king  and brought the king word back again  saying  all that was committed to thy servants  they do  it    
   and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the lord  and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers  and to the hand of the workmen   
   then shaphan the scribe told the king  saying  hilkiah the priest hath given me a book  and shaphan read it before the king   
   and it came to pass  when the king had heard the words of the law  that he rent his clothes   
   and the king commanded hilkiah  and ahikam the son of shaphan  and abdon the son of micah  and shaphan the scribe  and asaiah a servant of the king s  saying   
   go  enquire of the lord for me  and for them that are left in israel and in judah  concerning the words of the book that is found  for great  is  the wrath of the lord that is poured out upon us  because our fathers have not kept the word of the lord  to do after all that is written in this book   
   and hilkiah  and  they  that the king  had appointed   went to huldah the prophetess  the wife of shallum the son of tikvath  the son of hasrah  keeper of the wardrobe   now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college   and they spake to her to that  effect    
   and she answered them  thus saith the lord god of israel  tell ye the man that sent you to me   
   thus saith the lord  behold  i will bring evil upon this place  and upon the inhabitants thereof   even  all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of judah   
   because they have forsaken me  and have burned incense unto other gods  that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands  therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place  and shall not be quenched   
   and as for the king of judah  who sent you to enquire of the lord  so shall ye say unto him  thus saith the lord god of israel  concerning  the words which thou hast heard   
   because thine heart was tender  and thou didst humble thyself before god  when thou heardest his words against this place  and against the inhabitants thereof  and humbledst thyself before me  and didst rend thy clothes  and weep before me  i have even heard  thee  also  saith the lord   
   behold  i will gather thee to thy fathers  and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace  neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that i will bring upon this place  and upon the inhabitants of the same  so they brought the king word again   
    then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of judah and jerusalem   
   and the king went up into the house of the lord  and all the men of judah  and the inhabitants of jerusalem  and the priests  and the levites  and all the people  great and small  and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the lord   
   and the king stood in his place  and made a covenant before the lord  to walk after the lord  and to keep his commandments  and his testimonies  and his statutes  with all his heart  and with all his soul  to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book   
   and he caused all that were present in jerusalem and benjamin to stand  to it   and the inhabitants of jerusalem did according to the covenant of god  the god of their fathers   
   and josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that  pertained  to the children of israel  and made all that were present in israel to serve   even  to serve the lord their god   and  all his days they departed not from following the lord  the god of their fathers   
  chronicles    
   moreover josiah kept a passover unto the lord in jerusalem  and they killed the passover on the fourteenth  day  of the first month   
  and he set the priests in their charges  and encouraged them to the service of the house of the lord   
  and said unto the levites that taught all israel  which were holy unto the lord  put the holy ark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel did build   it shall  not  be  a burden upon  your  shoulders  serve now the lord your god  and his people israel   
  and prepare  yourselves  by the houses of your fathers  after your courses  according to the writing of david king of israel  and according to the writing of solomon his son   
  and stand in the holy  place  according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people  and  after  the division of the families of the levites   
  so kill the passover  and sanctify yourselves  and prepare your brethren  that  they  may do according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses   
  and josiah gave to the people  of the flock  lambs and kids  all for the passover offerings  for all that were present  to the number of thirty thousand  and three thousand bullocks  these  were  of the king s substance   
  and his princes gave willingly unto the people  to the priests  and to the levites  hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel  rulers of the house of god  gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred  small cattle   and three hundred oxen   
  conaniah also  and shemaiah and nethaneel  his brethren  and hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad  chief of the levites  gave unto the levites for passover offerings five thousand  small cattle   and five hundred oxen   
   so the service was prepared  and the priests stood in their place  and the levites in their courses  according to the king s commandment   
   and they killed the passover  and the priests sprinkled  the blood  from their hands  and the levites flayed  them    
   and they removed the burnt offerings  that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people  to offer unto the lord  as  it is  written in the book of moses  and so  did they  with the oxen   
   and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance  but the  other  holy  offerings  sod they in pots  and in caldrons  and in pans  and divided  them  speedily among all the people   
   and afterward they made ready for themselves  and for the priests  because the priests the sons of aaron  were busied  in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night  therefore the levites prepared for themselves  and for the priests the sons of aaron   
   and the singers the sons of asaph  were  in their place  according to the commandment of david  and asaph  and heman  and jeduthun the king s seer  and the porters  waited  at every gate  they might not depart from their service  for their brethren the levites prepared for them   
   so all the service of the lord was prepared the same day  to keep the passover  and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the lord  according to the commandment of king josiah   
   and the children of israel that were present kept the passover at that time  and the feast of unleavened bread seven days   
   and there was no passover like to that kept in israel from the days of samuel the prophet  neither did all the kings of israel keep such a passover as josiah kept  and the priests  and the levites  and all judah and israel that were present  and the inhabitants of jerusalem   
   in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passover kept   
    after all this  when josiah had prepared the temple  necho king of egypt came up to fight against carchemish by euphrates  and josiah went out against him   
   but he sent ambassadors to him  saying  what have i to do with thee  thou king of judah   i come  not against thee this day  but against the house wherewith i have war  for god commanded me to make haste  forbear thee from  meddling with  god  who  is  with me  that he destroy thee not   
   nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him  but disguised himself  that he might fight with him  and hearkened not unto the words of necho from the mouth of god  and came to fight in the valley of megiddo   
   and the archers shot at king josiah  and the king said to his servants  have me away  for i am sore wounded   
   his servants therefore took him out of that chariot  and put him in the second chariot that he had  and they brought him to jerusalem  and he died  and was buried in  one of  the sepulchres of his fathers  and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah   
   and jeremiah lamented for josiah  and all the singing men and the singing women spake of josiah in their lamentations to this day  and made them an ordinance in israel  and  behold  they  are  written in the lamentations   
   now the rest of the acts of josiah  and his goodness  according to  that which was  written in the law of the lord   
   and his deeds  first and last  behold  they  are  written in the book of the kings of israel and judah   
  chronicles    
   then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah  and made him king in his father s stead in jerusalem   
  jehoahaz  was  twenty and three years old when he began to reign  and he reigned three months in jerusalem   
  and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem  and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold   
  and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah and jerusalem  and turned his name to jehoiakim  and necho took jehoahaz his brother  and carried him to egypt   
  jehoiakim  was  twenty and five years old when he began to reign  and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem  and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord his god   
  against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  and bound him in fetters  to carry him to babylon   
  nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the lord to babylon  and put them in his temple at babylon   
  now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim  and his abominations which he did  and that which was found in him  behold  they  are  written in the book of the kings of israel and judah  and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead   
  jehoiachin  was  eight years old when he began to reign  and he reigned three months and ten days in jerusalem  and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord   
   and when the year was expired  king nebuchadnezzar sent  and brought him to babylon  with the goodly vessels of the house of the lord  and made zedekiah his brother king over judah and jerusalem   
    zedekiah  was  one and twenty years old when he began to reign  and reigned eleven years in jerusalem   
   and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the lord his god   and  humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet  speaking  from the mouth of the lord   
   and he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar  who had made him swear by god  but he stiffened his neck  and hardened his heart from turning unto the lord god of israel   
   moreover all the chief of the priests  and the people  transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen  and polluted the house of the lord which he had hallowed in jerusalem   
   and the lord god of their fathers sent to them by his messengers  rising up betimes  and sending  because he had compassion on his people  and on his dwelling place   
   but they mocked the messengers of god  and despised his words  and misused his prophets  until the wrath of the lord arose against his people  till  there was  no remedy   
   therefore he brought upon them the king of the chaldees  who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary  and had no compassion upon young man or maiden  old man  or him that stooped for age  he gave  them  all into his hand   
   and all the vessels of the house of god  great and small  and the treasures of the house of the lord  and the treasures of the king  and of his princes  all  these  he brought to babylon   
   and they burnt the house of god  and brake down the wall of jerusalem  and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire  and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof   
   and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to babylon  where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of persia   
   to fulfil the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah  until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths   for  as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath  to fulfil threescore and ten years   
    now in the first year of cyrus king of persia  that the word of the lord  spoken  by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished  the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia  that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom  and  put it  also in writing  saying   
   thus saith cyrus king of persia  all the kingdoms of the earth hath the lord god of heaven given me  and he hath charged me to build him an house in jerusalem  which  is  in judah  who  is there  among you of all his people  the lord his god  be  with him  and let him go up   
 
ezra 
ezra   
   now in the first year of cyrus king of persia  that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled  the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia  that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom  and  put it  also in writing  saying   
  thus saith cyrus king of persia  the lord god of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth  and he hath charged me to build him an house at jerusalem  which  is  in judah   
  who  is there  among you of all his people  his god be with him  and let him go up to jerusalem  which  is  in judah  and build the house of the lord god of israel   he  is  the god   which  is  in jerusalem   
  and whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth  let the men of his place help him with silver  and with gold  and with goods  and with beasts  beside the freewill offering for the house of god that  is  in jerusalem   
   then rose up the chief of the fathers of judah and benjamin  and the priests  and the levites  with all  them  whose spirit god had raised  to go up to build the house of the lord which  is  in jerusalem   
  and all they that  were  about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver  with gold  with goods  and with beasts  and with precious things  beside all  that  was willingly offered   
  also cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the lord  which nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of jerusalem  and had put them in the house of his gods   
  even those did cyrus king of persia bring forth by the hand of mithredath the treasurer  and numbered them unto sheshbazzar  the prince of judah   
  and this  is  the number of them  thirty chargers of gold  a thousand chargers of silver  nine and twenty knives   
   thirty basons of gold  silver basons of a second  sort  four hundred and ten   and  other vessels a thousand   
   all the vessels of gold and of silver  were  five thousand and four hundred  all  these  did sheshbazzar bring up with  them of  the captivity that were brought up from babylon unto jerusalem   
ezra

   all the nethinims  and the children of solomon s servants   were  three hundred ninety and two   
   and these  were  they which went up from telmelah  telharsa  cherub  addan   and  immer  but they could not shew their father s house  and their seed  whether they  were  of israel   
   the children of delaiah  the children of tobiah  the children of nekoda  six hundred fifty and two   
   and of the children of the priests  the children of habaiah  the children of koz  the children of barzillai  which took a wife of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite  and was called after their name   
   these sought their register  among  those that were reckoned by genealogy  but they were not found  therefore were they  as polluted  put from the priesthood   
   and the tirshatha said unto them  that they should not eat of the most holy things  till there stood up a priest with urim and with thummim   
    the whole congregation together  was  forty and two thousand three hundred  and  threescore   
   beside their servants and their maids  of whom  there were  seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven  and  there were  among them two hundred singing men and singing women   
   their horses  were  seven hundred thirty and six  their mules  two hundred forty and five   
   their camels  four hundred thirty and five   their  asses  six thousand seven hundred and twenty   
   and  some  of the chief of the fathers  when they came to the house of the lord which  is  at jerusalem  offered freely for the house of god to set it up in his place   
   they gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold  and five thousand pound of silver  and one hundred priests  garments   
   so the priests  and the levites  and  some  of the people  and the singers  and the porters  and the nethinims  dwelt in their cities  and all israel in their cities   
ezra   
   and when the seventh month was come  and the children of israel  were  in the cities  the people gathered themselves together as one man to jerusalem   
  then stood up jeshua the son of jozadak  and his brethren the priests  and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel  and his brethren  and builded the altar of the god of israel  to offer burnt offerings thereon  as  it is  written in the law of moses the man of god   
  and they set the altar upon his bases  for fear  was  upon them because of the people of those countries  and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the lord   even  burnt offerings morning and evening   
  they kept also the feast of tabernacles  as  it is  written  and  offered  the daily burnt offerings by number  according to the custom  as the duty of every day required   
  and afterward  offered  the continual burnt offering  both of the new moons  and of all the set feasts of the lord that were consecrated  and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the lord   
  from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the lord  but the foundation of the temple of the lord was not  yet  laid   
  they gave money also unto the masons  and to the carpenters  and meat  and drink  and oil  unto them of zidon  and to them of tyre  to bring cedar trees from lebanon to the sea of joppa  according to the grant that they had of cyrus king of persia   
   now in the second year of their coming unto the house of god at jerusalem  in the second month  began zerubbabel the son of shealtiel  and jeshua the son of jozadak  and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the levites  and all they that were come out of the captivity unto jerusalem  and appointed the levites  from twenty years old and upward  to set forward the work of the house of the lord   
  then stood jeshua  with  his sons and his brethren  kadmiel and his sons  the sons of judah  together  to set forward the workmen in the house of god  the sons of henadad   with  their sons and their brethren the levites   
   and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the lord  they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets  and the levites the sons of asaph with cymbals  to praise the lord  after the ordinance of david king of israel   
   and they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the lord  because  he is  good  for his mercy  endureth  for ever toward israel  and all the people shouted with a great shout  when they praised the lord  because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid   
   but many of the priests and levites and chief of the fathers   who were  ancient men  that had seen the first house  when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes  wept with a loud voice  and many shouted aloud for joy   
   so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people  for the people shouted with a loud shout  and the noise was heard afar off   
ezra   
   now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the lord god of israel   
  then they came to zerubbabel  and to the chief of the fathers  and said unto them  let us build with you  for we seek your god  as ye  do   and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of esarhaddon king of assur  which brought us up hither   
  but zerubbabel  and jeshua  and the rest of the chief of the fathers of israel  said unto them  ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our god  but we ourselves together will build unto the lord god of israel  as king cyrus the king of persia hath commanded us   
  then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah  and troubled them in building   
  and hired counsellors against them  to frustrate their purpose  all the days of cyrus king of persia  even until the reign of darius king of persia   
   and in the reign of ahasuerus  in the beginning of his reign  wrote they  unto him  an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and jerusalem   
  and in the days of artaxerxes wrote bishlam  mithredath  tabeel  and the rest of their companions  unto artaxerxes king of persia  and the writing of the letter  was  written in the syrian tongue  and interpreted in the syrian tongue   
  rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort   
  then  wrote  rehum the chancellor  and shimshai the scribe  and the rest of their companions  the dinaites  the apharsathchites  the tarpelites  the apharsites  the archevites  the babylonians  the susanchites  the dehavites   and  the elamites   
   and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble asnappar brought over  and set in the cities of samaria  and the rest  that are  on this side the river  and at such a time   
   this  is  the copy of the letter that they sent unto him   even  unto artaxerxes the king  thy servants the men on this side the river  and at such a time   
   be it known unto the king  that the jews which came up from thee to us are come unto jerusalem  building the rebellious and the bad city  and have set up the walls  thereof   and joined the foundations   
   be it known now unto the king  that  if this city be builded  and the walls set up  again  then  will they not pay toll  tribute  and custom  and  so  thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings   
   now because we have maintenance from  the king s  palace  and it was not meet for us to see the king s dishonour  therefore have we sent and certified the king   
   that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers  so shalt thou find in the book of the records  and know that this city  is  a rebellious city  and hurtful unto kings and provinces  and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time  for which cause was this city destroyed   
   we certify the king that  if this city be builded  again   and the walls thereof set up  by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river   
     then  sent the king an answer unto rehum the chancellor  and  to  shimshai the scribe  and  to  the rest of their companions that dwell in samaria  and  unto  the rest beyond the river  peace  and at such a time   
   the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me   
   and i commanded  and search hath been made  and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings  and  that  rebellion and sedition have been made therein   
   there have been mighty kings also over jerusalem  which have ruled over all  countries  beyond the river  and toll  tribute  and custom  was paid unto them   
   give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease  and that this city be not builded  until  another  commandment shall be given from me   
   take heed now that ye fail not to do this  why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings   
   now when the copy of king artaxerxes  letter  was  read before rehum  and shimshai the scribe  and their companions  they went up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews  and made them to cease by force and power   
   then ceased the work of the house of god which  is  at jerusalem  so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of darius king of persia   
ezra   
   then the prophets  haggai the prophet  and zechariah the son of iddo  prophesied unto the jews that  were  in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel   even  unto them   
  then rose up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel  and jeshua the son of jozadak  and began to build the house of god which  is  at jerusalem  and with them  were  the prophets of god helping them   
   at the same time came to them tatnai  governor on this side the river  and shetharboznai  and their companions  and said thus unto them  who hath commanded you to build this house  and to make up this wall   
  then said we unto them after this manner  what are the names of the men that make this building   
  but the eye of their god was upon the elders of the jews  that they could not cause them to cease  till the matter came to darius  and then they returned answer by letter concerning this  matter    
  the copy of the letter that tatnai  governor on this side the river  and shetharboznai  and his companions the apharsachites  which  were  on this side the river  sent unto darius the king   
  they sent a letter unto him  wherein was written thus  unto darius the king  all peace   
  be it known unto the king  that we went into the province of judea  to the house of the great god  which is builded with great stones  and timber is laid in the walls  and this work goeth fast on  and prospereth in their hands   
  then asked we those elders   and  said unto them thus  who commanded you to build this house  and to make up these walls   
   we asked their names also  to certify thee  that we might write the names of the men that  were  the chief of them   
   and thus they returned us answer  saying  we are the servants of the god of heaven and earth  and build the house that was builded these many years ago  which a great king of israel builded and set up   
   but after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven unto wrath  he gave them into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon  the chaldean  who destroyed this house  and carried the people away into babylon   
   but in the first year of cyrus the king of babylon  the same  king cyrus made a decree to build this house of god   
   and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of god  which nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that  was  in jerusalem  and brought them into the temple of babylon  those did cyrus the king take out of the temple of babylon  and they were delivered unto  one   whose name  was  sheshbazzar  whom he had made governor   
   and said unto him  take these vessels  go  carry them into the temple that  is  in jerusalem  and let the house of god be builded in his place   
   then came the same sheshbazzar   and  laid the foundation of the house of god which  is  in jerusalem  and since that time even until now hath it been in building  and  yet  it is not finished   
   now therefore  if  it seem  good to the king  let there be search made in the king s treasure house  which  is  there at babylon  whether it be  so   that a decree was made of cyrus the king to build this house of god at jerusalem  and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter   
ezra   
   then darius the king made a decree  and search was made in the house of the rolls  where the treasures were laid up in babylon   
  and there was found at achmetha  in the palace that  is  in the province of the medes  a roll  and therein  was  a record thus written   
  in the first year of cyrus the king  the same  cyrus the king made a decree  concerning  the house of god at jerusalem  let the house be builded  the place where they offered sacrifices  and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid  the height thereof threescore cubits   and  the breadth thereof threescore cubits   
   with  three rows of great stones  and a row of new timber  and let the expenses be given out of the king s house   
  and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of god  which nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which  is  at jerusalem  and brought unto babylon  be restored  and brought again unto the temple which  is  at jerusalem   every one  to his place  and place  them  in the house of god   
  now  therefore   tatnai  governor beyond the river  shetharboznai  and your companions the apharsachites  which  are  beyond the river  be ye far from thence   
  let the work of this house of god alone  let the governor of the jews and the elders of the jews build this house of god in his place   
  moreover i make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these jews for the building of this house of god  that of the king s goods   even  of the tribute beyond the river  forthwith expenses be given unto these men  that they be not hindered   
  and that which they have need of  both young bullocks  and rams  and lambs  for the burnt offerings of the god of heaven  wheat  salt  wine  and oil  according to the appointment of the priests which  are  at jerusalem  let it be given them day by day without fail   
   that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the god of heaven  and pray for the life of the king  and of his sons   
   also i have made a decree  that whosoever shall alter this word  let timber be pulled down from his house  and being set up  let him be hanged thereon  and let his house be made a dunghill for this   
   and the god that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people  that shall put to their hand to alter  and  to destroy this house of god which  is  at jerusalem  i darius have made a decree  let it be done with speed   
    then tatnai  governor on this side the river  shetharboznai  and their companions  according to that which darius the king had sent  so they did speedily   
   and the elders of the jews builded  and they prospered through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo  and they builded  and finished  it   according to the commandment of the god of israel  and according to the commandment of cyrus  and darius  and artaxerxes king of persia   
   and this house was finished on the third day of the month adar  which was in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king   
   and the children of israel  the priests  and the levites  and the rest of the children of the captivity  kept the dedication of this house of god with joy   
   and offered at the dedication of this house of god an hundred bullocks  two hundred rams  four hundred lambs  and for a sin offering for all israel  twelve he goats  according to the number of the tribes of israel   
   and they set the priests in their divisions  and the levites in their courses  for the service of god  which  is  at jerusalem  as it is written in the book of moses   
   and the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth  day  of the first month   
   for the priests and the levites were purified together  all of them  were  pure  and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity  and for their brethren the priests  and for themselves   
   and the children of israel  which were come again out of captivity  and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land  to seek the lord god of israel  did eat   
   and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy  for the lord had made them joyful  and turned the heart of the king of assyria unto them  to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of god  the god of israel   
ezra   
   now after these things  in the reign of artaxerxes king of persia  ezra the son of seraiah  the son of azariah  the son of hilkiah   
  the son of shallum  the son of zadok  the son of ahitub   
  the son of amariah  the son of azariah  the son of meraioth   
  the son of zerahiah  the son of uzzi  the son of bukki   
  the son of abishua  the son of phinehas  the son of eleazar  the son of aaron the chief priest   
  this ezra went up from babylon  and he  was  a ready scribe in the law of moses  which the lord god of israel had given  and the king granted him all his request  according to the hand of the lord his god upon him   
  and there went up  some  of the children of israel  and of the priests  and the levites  and the singers  and the porters  and the nethinims  unto jerusalem  in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king   
  and he came to jerusalem in the fifth month  which  was  in the seventh year of the king   
  for upon the first  day  of the first month began he to go up from babylon  and on the first  day  of the fifth month came he to jerusalem  according to the good hand of his god upon him   
   for ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the lord  and to do  it   and to teach in israel statutes and judgments   
    now this  is  the copy of the letter that the king artaxerxes gave unto ezra the priest  the scribe   even  a scribe of the words of the commandments of the lord  and of his statutes to israel   
   artaxerxes  king of kings  unto ezra the priest  a scribe of the law of the god of heaven  perfect  peace   and at such a time   
   i make a decree  that all they of the people of israel  and  of  his priests and levites  in my realm  which are minded of their own freewill to go up to jerusalem  go with thee   
   forasmuch as thou art sent of the king  and of his seven counsellors  to enquire concerning judah and jerusalem  according to the law of thy god which  is  in thine hand   
   and to carry the silver and gold  which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the god of israel  whose habitation  is  in jerusalem   
   and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of babylon  with the freewill offering of the people  and of the priests  offering willingly for the house of their god which  is  in jerusalem   
   that thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks  rams  lambs  with their meat offerings and their drink offerings  and offer them upon the altar of the house of your god which  is  in jerusalem   
   and whatsoever shall seem good to thee  and to thy brethren  to do with the rest of the silver and the gold  that do after the will of your god   
   the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy god   those  deliver thou before the god of jerusalem   
   and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy god  which thou shalt have occasion to bestow  bestow  it  out of the king s treasure house   
   and i   even  i artaxerxes the king  do make a decree to all the treasurers which  are  beyond the river  that whatsoever ezra the priest  the scribe of the law of the god of heaven  shall require of you  it be done speedily   
   unto an hundred talents of silver  and to an hundred measures of wheat  and to an hundred baths of wine  and to an hundred baths of oil  and salt without prescribing  how much    
   whatsoever is commanded by the god of heaven  let it be diligently done for the house of the god of heaven  for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons   
   also we certify you  that touching any of the priests and levites  singers  porters  nethinims  or ministers of this house of god  it shall not be lawful to impose toll  tribute  or custom  upon them   
   and thou  ezra  after the wisdom of thy god  that  is  in thine hand  set magistrates and judges  which may judge all the people that  are  beyond the river  all such as know the laws of thy god  and teach ye them that know  them  not   
   and whosoever will not do the law of thy god  and the law of the king  let judgment be executed speedily upon him  whether  it be  unto death  or to banishment  or to confiscation of goods  or to imprisonment   
    blessed  be  the lord god of our fathers  which hath put  such a thing  as this in the king s heart  to beautify the house of the lord which  is  in jerusalem   
   and hath extended mercy unto me before the king  and his counsellors  and before all the king s mighty princes  and i was strengthened as the hand of the lord my god  was  upon me  and i gathered together out of israel chief men to go up with me   
ezra   
   these  are  now the chief of their fathers  and  this is  the genealogy of them that went up with me from babylon  in the reign of artaxerxes the king   
  of the sons of phinehas  gershom  of the sons of ithamar  daniel  of the sons of david  hattush   
  of the sons of shechaniah  of the sons of pharosh  zechariah  and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty   
  of the sons of pahathmoab  elihoenai the son of zerahiah  and with him two hundred males   
  of the sons of shechaniah  the son of jahaziel  and with him three hundred males   
  of the sons also of adin  ebed the son of jonathan  and with him fifty males   
  and of the sons of elam  jeshaiah the son of athaliah  and with him seventy males   
  and of the sons of shephatiah  zebadiah the son of michael  and with him fourscore males   
  of the sons of joab  obadiah the son of jehiel  and with him two hundred and eighteen males   
   and of the sons of shelomith  the son of josiphiah  and with him an hundred and threescore males   
   and of the sons of bebai  zechariah the son of bebai  and with him twenty and eight males   
   and of the sons of azgad  johanan the son of hakkatan  and with him an hundred and ten males   
   and of the last sons of adonikam  whose names  are  these  eliphelet  jeiel  and shemaiah  and with them threescore males   
   of the sons also of bigvai  uthai  and zabbud  and with them seventy males   
   and i gathered them together to the river that runneth to ahava  and there abode we in tents three days  and i viewed the people  and the priests  and found there none of the sons of levi   
   then sent i for eliezer  for ariel  for shemaiah  and for elnathan  and for jarib  and for elnathan  and for nathan  and for zechariah  and for meshullam  chief men  also for joiarib  and for elnathan  men of understanding   
   and i sent them with commandment unto iddo the chief at the place casiphia  and i told them what they should say unto iddo   and  to his brethren the nethinims  at the place casiphia  that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our god   
   and by the good hand of our god upon us they brought us a man of understanding  of the sons of mahli  the son of levi  the son of israel  and sherebiah  with his sons and his brethren  eighteen   
   and hashabiah  and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari  his brethren and their sons  twenty   
   also of the nethinims  whom david and the princes had appointed for the service of the levites  two hundred and twenty nethinims  all of them were expressed by name   
    then i proclaimed a fast there  at the river of ahava  that we might afflict ourselves before our god  to seek of him a right way for us  and for our little ones  and for all our substance   
   for i was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way  because we had spoken unto the king  saying  the hand of our god  is  upon all them for good that seek him  but his power and his wrath  is  against all them that forsake him   
   so we fasted and besought our god for this  and he was intreated of us   
    then i separated twelve of the chief of the priests  sherebiah  hashabiah  and ten of their brethren with them   
   and weighed unto them the silver  and the gold  and the vessels   even  the offering of the house of our god  which the king  and his counsellors  and his lords  and all israel  there  present  had offered   
   i even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver  and silver vessels an hundred talents   and  of gold an hundred talents   
   also twenty basons of gold  of a thousand drams  and two vessels of fine copper  precious as gold   
   and i said unto them  ye  are  holy unto the lord  the vessels  are  holy also  and the silver and the gold  are  a freewill offering unto the lord god of your fathers   
   watch ye  and keep  them   until ye weigh  them  before the chief of the priests and the levites  and chief of the fathers of israel  at jerusalem  in the chambers of the house of the lord   
   so took the priests and the levites the weight of the silver  and the gold  and the vessels  to bring  them  to jerusalem unto the house of our god   
    then we departed from the river of ahava on the twelfth  day  of the first month  to go unto jerusalem  and the hand of our god was upon us  and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy  and of such as lay in wait by the way   
   and we came to jerusalem  and abode there three days   
   now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our god by the hand of meremoth the son of uriah the priest  and with him  was  eleazar the son of phinehas  and with them  was  jozabad the son of jeshua  and noadiah the son of binnui  levites   
   by number  and  by weight of every one  and all the weight was written at that time   
    also  the children of those that had been carried away  which were come out of the captivity  offered burnt offerings unto the god of israel  twelve bullocks for all israel  ninety and six rams  seventy and seven lambs  twelve he goats  for  a sin offering  all  this was  a burnt offering unto the lord   
   and they delivered the king s commissions unto the king s lieutenants  and to the governors on this side the river  and they furthered the people  and the house of god   
ezra   
   now when these things were done  the princes came to me  saying  the people of israel  and the priests  and the levites  have not separated themselves from the people of the lands   doing  according to their abominations   even  of the canaanites  the hittites  the perizzites  the jebusites  the ammonites  the moabites  the egyptians  and the amorites   
  for they have taken of their daughters for themselves  and for their sons  so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of  those  lands  yea  the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass   
  and when i heard this thing  i rent my garment and my mantle  and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard  and sat down astonied   
  then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the god of israel  because of the transgression of those that had been carried away  and i sat astonied until the evening sacrifice   
   and at the evening sacrifice i arose up from my heaviness  and having rent my garment and my mantle  i fell upon my knees  and spread out my hands unto the lord my god   
  and said  o my god  i am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee  my god  for our iniquities are increased over  our  head  and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens   
  since the days of our fathers  have  we  been  in a great trespass unto this day  and for our iniquities have we  our kings   and  our priests  been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands  to the sword  to captivity  and to a spoil  and to confusion of face  as  it is  this day   
  and now for a little space grace hath been  shewed  from the lord our god  to leave us a remnant to escape  and to give us a nail in his holy place  that our god may lighten our eyes  and give us a little reviving in our bondage   
  for we  were  bondmen  yet our god hath not forsaken us in our bondage  but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of persia  to give us a reviving  to set up the house of our god  and to repair the desolations thereof  and to give us a wall in judah and in jerusalem   
   and now  o our god  what shall we say after this  for we have forsaken thy commandments   
   which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets  saying  the land  unto which ye go to possess it  is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands  with their abominations  which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness   
   now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons  neither take their daughters unto your sons  nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever  that ye may be strong  and eat the good of the land  and leave  it  for an inheritance to your children for ever   
   and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds  and for our great trespass  seeing that thou our god hast punished us less than our iniquities  deserve   and hast given us  such  deliverance as this   
   should we again break thy commandments  and join in affinity with the people of these abominations  wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed  us   so that  there should be  no remnant nor escaping   
   o lord god of israel  thou  art  righteous  for we remain yet escaped  as  it is  this day  behold  we  are  before thee in our trespasses  for we cannot stand before thee because of this   
ezra    
   now when ezra had prayed  and when he had confessed  weeping and casting himself down before the house of god  there assembled unto him out of israel a very great congregation of men and women and children  for the people wept very sore   
  and shechaniah the son of jehiel   one  of the sons of elam  answered and said unto ezra  we have trespassed against our god  and have taken strange wives of the people of the land  yet now there is hope in israel concerning this thing   
  now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away all the wives  and such as are born of them  according to the counsel of my lord  and of those that tremble at the commandment of our god  and let it be done according to the law   
  arise  for  this  matter  belongeth  unto thee  we also  will be  with thee  be of good courage  and do  it    
  then arose ezra  and made the chief priests  the levites  and all israel  to swear that they should do according to this word  and they sware   
   then ezra rose up from before the house of god  and went into the chamber of johanan the son of eliashib  and  when  he came thither  he did eat no bread  nor drink water  for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away   
  and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity  that they should gather themselves together unto jerusalem   
  and that whosoever would not come within three days  according to the counsel of the princes and the elders  all his substance should be forfeited  and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away   
  then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselves together unto jerusalem within three days  it  was  the ninth month  on the twentieth  day  of the month  and all the people sat in the street of the house of god  trembling because of  this  matter  and for the great rain   
   and ezra the priest stood up  and said unto them  ye have transgressed  and have taken strange wives  to increase the trespass of israel   
   now therefore make confession unto the lord god of your fathers  and do his pleasure  and separate yourselves from the people of the land  and from the strange wives   
   then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice  as thou hast said  so must we do   
   but the people  are  many  and  it is  a time of much rain  and we are not able to stand without  neither  is this  a work of one day or two  for we are many that have transgressed in this thing   
   let now our rulers of all the congregation stand  and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times  and with them the elders of every city  and the judges thereof  until the fierce wrath of our god for this matter be turned from us   
    only jonathan the son of asahel and jahaziah the son of tikvah were employed about this  matter   and meshullam and shabbethai the levite helped them   
   and the children of the captivity did so  and ezra the priest   with  certain chief of the fathers  after the house of their fathers  and all of them by  their  names  were separated  and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter   
   and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month   
   and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives   namely   of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak  and his brethren  maaseiah  and eliezer  and jarib  and gedaliah   
   and they gave their hands that they would put away their wives  and  being  guilty   they offered  a ram of the flock for their trespass   
   and of the sons of immer  hanani  and zebadiah   
   and of the sons of harim  maaseiah  and elijah  and shemaiah  and jehiel  and uzziah   
   and of the sons of pashur  elioenai  maaseiah  ishmael  nethaneel  jozabad  and elasah

   all these had taken strange wives  and  some  of them had wives by whom they had children   
 
nehemiah 
nehemiah   
   the words of nehemiah the son of hachaliah  and it came to pass in the month chisleu  in the twentieth year  as i was in shushan the palace   
  that hanani  one of my brethren  came  he and  certain  men of judah  and i asked them concerning the jews that had escaped  which were left of the captivity  and concerning jerusalem   
  and they said unto me  the remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province  are  in great affliction and reproach  the wall of jerusalem also  is  broken down  and the gates thereof are burned with fire   
  and it came to pass  when i heard these words  that i sat down and wept  and mourned  certain  days  and fasted  and prayed before the god of heaven   
   and said  i beseech thee  o lord god of heaven  the great and terrible god  that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments   
  let thine ear now be attentive  and thine eyes open  that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant  which i pray before thee now  day and night  for the children of israel thy servants  and confess the sins of the children of israel  which we have sinned against thee  both i and my father s house have sinned   
  we have dealt very corruptly against thee  and have not kept the commandments  nor the statutes  nor the judgments  which thou commandedst thy servant moses   
  remember  i beseech thee  the word that thou commandedst thy servant moses  saying   if  ye transgress  i will scatter you abroad among the nations   
  but  if  ye turn unto me  and keep my commandments  and do them  though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven   yet  will i gather them from thence  and will bring them unto the place that i have chosen to set my name there   
   now these  are  thy servants and thy people  whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power  and by thy strong hand   
   o lord  i beseech thee  let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant  and to the prayer of thy servants  who desire to fear thy name  and prosper  i pray thee  thy servant this day  and grant him mercy in the sight of this man  for i was the king s cupbearer   
nehemiah   
   and it came to pass in the month nisan  in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king   that  wine  was  before him  and i took up the wine  and gave  it  unto the king  now i had not been  beforetime  sad in his presence   
  wherefore the king said unto me  why  is  thy countenance sad  seeing thou  art  not sick  this  is  nothing  else  but sorrow of heart  then i was very sore afraid   
  and said unto the king  let the king live for ever  why should not my countenance be sad  when the city  the place of my fathers  sepulchres   lieth  waste  and the gates thereof are consumed with fire   
  then the king said unto me  for what dost thou make request  so i prayed to the god of heaven   
  and i said unto the king  if it please the king  and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight  that thou wouldest send me unto judah  unto the city of my fathers  sepulchres  that i may build it   
  and the king said unto me   the queen also sitting by him   for how long shall thy journey be  and when wilt thou return  so it pleased the king to send me  and i set him a time   
  moreover i said unto the king  if it please the king  let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river  that they may convey me over till i come into judah   
  and a letter unto asaph the keeper of the king s forest  that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which  appertained  to the house  and for the wall of the city  and for the house that i shall enter into  and the king granted me  according to the good hand of my god upon me   
   then i came to the governors beyond the river  and gave them the king s letters  now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me   
   when sanballat the horonite  and tobiah the servant  the ammonite  heard  of it   it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of israel   
   so i came to jerusalem  and was there three days   
   and i arose in the night  i and some few men with me  neither told i  any  man what my god had put in my heart to do at jerusalem  neither  was there any  beast with me  save the beast that i rode upon   
   and i went out by night by the gate of the valley  even before the dragon well  and to the dung port  and viewed the walls of jerusalem  which were broken down  and the gates thereof were consumed with fire   
   then i went on to the gate of the fountain  and to the king s pool  but  there was  no place for the beast  that was  under me to pass   
   then went i up in the night by the brook  and viewed the wall  and turned back  and entered by the gate of the valley  and  so  returned   
   and the rulers knew not whither i went  or what i did  neither had i as yet told  it  to the jews  nor to the priests  nor to the nobles  nor to the rulers  nor to the rest that did the work   
   then said i unto them  ye see the distress that we  are  in  how jerusalem  lieth  waste  and the gates thereof are burned with fire  come  and let us build up the wall of jerusalem  that we be no more a reproach   
   then i told them of the hand of my god which was good upon me  as also the king s words that he had spoken unto me  and they said  let us rise up and build  so they strengthened their hands for  this  good  work    
   but when sanballat the horonite  and tobiah the servant  the ammonite  and geshem the arabian  heard  it   they laughed us to scorn  and despised us  and said  what  is  this thing that ye do  will ye rebel against the king   
   then answered i them  and said unto them  the god of heaven  he will prosper us  therefore we his servants will arise and build  but ye have no portion  nor right  nor memorial  in jerusalem

nehemiah   
   but it came to pass  that when sanballat heard that we builded the wall  he was wroth  and took great indignation  and mocked the jews   
  and he spake before his brethren and the army of samaria  and said  what do these feeble jews  will they fortify themselves  will they sacrifice  will they make an end in a day  will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned   
  now tobiah the ammonite  was  by him  and he said  even that which they build  if a fox go up  he shall even break down their stone wall   
  hear  o our god  for we are despised  and turn their reproach upon their own head  and give them for a prey in the land of captivity   
  and cover not their iniquity  and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee  for they have provoked  thee  to anger before the builders   
  so built we the wall  and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof  for the people had a mind to work   
   but it came to pass   that  when sanballat  and tobiah  and the arabians  and the ammonites  and the ashdodites  heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up   and  that the breaches began to be stopped  then they were very wroth   
  and conspired all of them together to come  and  to fight against jerusalem  and to hinder it   
  nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god  and set a watch against them day and night  because of them   
   and judah said  the strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed  and  there is  much rubbish  so that we are not able to build the wall   
   and our adversaries said  they shall not know  neither see  till we come in the midst among them  and slay them  and cause the work to cease   
   and it came to pass  that when the jews which dwelt by them came  they said unto us ten times  from all places whence ye shall return unto us  they will be upon you    
   therefore set i in the lower places behind the wall   and  on the higher places  i even set the people after their families with their swords  their spears  and their bows   
   and i looked  and rose up  and said unto the nobles  and to the rulers  and to the rest of the people  be not ye afraid of them  remember the lord   which is  great and terrible  and fight for your brethren  your sons  and your daughters  your wives  and your houses   
   and it came to pass  when our enemies heard that it was known unto us  and god had brought their counsel to nought  that we returned all of us to the wall  every one unto his work   
    and it came to pass from that time forth   that  the half of my servants wrought in the work  and the other half of them held both the spears  the shields  and the bows  and the habergeons  and the rulers  were  behind all the house of judah   
   they which builded on the wall  and they that bare burdens  with those that laded   every one  with one of his hands wrought in the work  and with the other  hand  held a weapon   
   for the builders  every one had his sword girded by his side  and  so  builded  and he that sounded the trumpet  was  by me   
   and i said unto the nobles  and to the rulers  and to the rest of the people  the work  is  great and large  and we are separated upon the wall  one far from another   
   in what place  therefore  ye hear the sound of the trumpet  resort ye thither unto us  our god shall fight for us   
   so we laboured in the work  and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared   
   likewise at the same time said i unto the people  let every one with his servant lodge within jerusalem  that in the night they may be a guard to us  and labour on the day   
   so neither i  nor my brethren  nor my servants  nor the men of the guard which followed me  none of us put off our clothes   saving that  every one put them off for washing   
nehemiah   
   and there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the jews   
  for there were that said  we  our sons  and our daughters   are  many  therefore we take up corn  for them   that we may eat  and live   
   some  also there were that said  we have mortgaged our lands  vineyards  and houses  that we might buy corn  because of the dearth   
  there were also that said  we have borrowed money for the king s tribute   and that upon  our lands and vineyards   
  yet now our flesh  is  as the flesh of our brethren  our children as their children  and  lo  we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants  and  some  of our daughters are brought unto bondage  already   neither  is it  in our power  to redeem them   for other men have our lands and vineyards   
   and i was very angry when i heard their cry and these words   
  then i consulted with myself  and i rebuked the nobles  and the rulers  and said unto them  ye exact usury  every one of his brother  and i set a great assembly against them   
  and i said unto them  we after our ability have redeemed our brethren the jews  which were sold unto the heathen  and will ye even sell your brethren  or shall they be sold unto us  then held they their peace  and found nothing  to answer    
  also i said  it  is  not good that ye do  ought ye not to walk in the fear of our god because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies   
   i likewise   and  my brethren  and my servants  might exact of them money and corn  i pray you  let us leave off this usury   
   restore  i pray you  to them  even this day  their lands  their vineyards  their oliveyards  and their houses  also the hundredth  part  of the money  and of the corn  the wine  and the oil  that ye exact of them   
   then said they  we will restore  them   and will require nothing of them  so will we do as thou sayest  then i called the priests  and took an oath of them  that they should do according to this promise   
   also i shook my lap  and said  so god shake out every man from his house  and from his labour  that performeth not this promise  even thus be he shaken out  and emptied  and all the congregation said  amen  and praised the lord  and the people did according to this promise   
    moreover from the time that i was appointed to be their governor in the land of judah  from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king   that is   twelve years  i and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor   
   but the former governors that  had been  before me were chargeable unto the people  and had taken of them bread and wine  beside forty shekels of silver  yea  even their servants bare rule over the people  but so did not i  because of the fear of god   
   yea  also i continued in the work of this wall  neither bought we any land  and all my servants  were  gathered thither unto the work   
   moreover  there were  at my table an hundred and fifty of the jews and rulers  beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that  are  about us   
   now  that  which was prepared  for me  daily  was  one ox  and  six choice sheep  also fowls were prepared for me  and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine  yet for all this required not i the bread of the governor  because the bondage was heavy upon this people   
   think upon me  my god  for good   according  to all that i have done for this people   
nehemiah   
   now it came to pass  when sanballat  and tobiah  and geshem the arabian  and the rest of our enemies  heard that i had builded the wall  and  that  there was no breach left therein   though at that time i had not set up the doors upon the gates    
  that sanballat and geshem sent unto me  saying  come  let us meet together in  some one of  the villages in the plain of ono  but they thought to do me mischief   
  and i sent messengers unto them  saying  i  am  doing a great work  so that i cannot come down  why should the work cease  whilst i leave it  and come down to you   
  yet they sent unto me four times after this sort  and i answered them after the same manner   
  then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand   
  wherein  was  written  it is reported among the heathen  and gashmu saith  it  that  thou and the jews think to rebel  for which cause thou buildest the wall  that thou mayest be their king  according to these words   
  and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at jerusalem  saying   there is  a king in judah  and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words  come now therefore  and let us take counsel together   
  then i sent unto him  saying  there are no such things done as thou sayest  but thou feignest them out of thine own heart   
  for they all made us afraid  saying  their hands shall be weakened from the work  that it be not done  now therefore   o god   strengthen my hands   
    afterward i came unto the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabeel  who  was  shut up  and he said  let us meet together in the house of god  within the temple  and let us shut the doors of the temple  for they will come to slay thee  yea  in the night will they come to slay thee   
   and i said  should such a man as i flee  and who  is there   that   being  as i  am   would go into the temple to save his life  i will not go in   
   and  lo  i perceived that god had not sent him  but that he pronounced this prophecy against me  for tobiah and sanballat had hired him   
   therefore  was  he hired  that i should be afraid  and do so  and sin  and  that  they might have  matter  for an evil report  that they might reproach me   
   my god  think thou upon tobiah and sanballat according to these their works  and on the prophetess noadiah  and the rest of the prophets  that would have put me in fear   
    so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth  day  of  the month  elul  in fifty and two days   
   and it came to pass  that when all our enemies heard  thereof   and all the heathen that  were  about us saw  these things   they were much cast down in their own eyes  for they perceived that this work was wrought of our god   
   moreover in those days the nobles of judah sent many letters unto tobiah  and  the letters  of tobiah came unto them   
   for  there were  many in judah sworn unto him  because he  was  the son in law of shechaniah the son of arah  and his son johanan had taken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah   
   also they reported his good deeds before me  and uttered my words to him   and  tobiah sent letters to put me in fear   
nehemiah   
   now it came to pass  when the wall was built  and i had set up the doors  and the porters and the singers and the levites were appointed   
  that i gave my brother hanani  and hananiah the ruler of the palace  charge over jerusalem  for he  was  a faithful man  and feared god above many   
  and i said unto them  let not the gates of jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot  and while they stand by  let them shut the doors  and bar  them   and appoint watches of the inhabitants of jerusalem  every one in his watch  and every one  to be  over against his house   
  now the city  was  large and great  but the people  were  few therein  and the houses  were  not builded   
   and my god put into mine heart to gather together the nobles  and the rulers  and the people  that they might be reckoned by genealogy  and i found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first  and found written therein   
  these  are  the children of the province  that went up out of the captivity  of those that had been carried away  whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away  and came again to jerusalem and to judah  every one unto his city

   all the nethinims  and the children of solomon s servants   were  three hundred ninety and two   
   and these  were  they which went up  also  from telmelah  telharesha  cherub  addon  and immer  but they could not shew their father s house  nor their seed  whether they  were  of israel   
   the children of delaiah  the children of tobiah  the children of nekoda  six hundred forty and two   
   and of the priests  the children of habaiah  the children of koz  the children of barzillai  which took  one  of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite to wife  and was called after their name   
   these sought their register  among  those that were reckoned by genealogy  but it was not found  therefore were they  as polluted  put from the priesthood   
   and the tirshatha said unto them  that they should not eat of the most holy things  till there stood  up  a priest with urim and thummim   
   the whole congregation together  was  forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore   
   beside their manservants and their maidservants  of whom  there were  seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven  and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women   
   their horses  seven hundred thirty and six  their mules  two hundred forty and five   
    their  camels  four hundred thirty and five  six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses

   and  some  of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold  and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver   
   and  that  which the rest of the people gave  was  twenty thousand drams of gold  and two thousand pound of silver  and threescore and seven priests  garments   
   so the priests  and the levites  and the porters  and the singers  and  some  of the people  and the nethinims  and all israel  dwelt in their cities  and when the seventh month came  the children of israel  were  in their cities   
nehemiah   
   and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that  was  before the water gate  and they spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses  which the lord had commanded to israel   
  and ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women  and all that could hear with understanding  upon the first day of the seventh month   
  and he read therein before the street that  was  before the water gate from the morning until midday  before the men and the women  and those that could understand  and the ears of all the people  were attentive  unto the book of the law   
  and ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood  which they had made for the purpose  and beside him stood mattithiah  and shema  and anaiah  and urijah  and hilkiah  and maaseiah  on his right hand  and on his left hand  pedaiah  and mishael  and malchiah  and hashum  and hashbadana  zechariah   and  meshullam   
  and ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people   for he was above all the people   and when he opened it  all the people stood up   
  and ezra blessed the lord  the great god  and all the people answered  amen  amen  with lifting up their hands  and they bowed their heads  and worshipped the lord with  their  faces to the ground   
  also jeshua  and bani  and sherebiah  jamin  akkub  shabbethai  hodijah  maaseiah  kelita  azariah  jozabad  hanan  pelaiah  and the levites  caused the people to understand the law  and the people  stood  in their place   
  so they read in the book in the law of god distinctly  and gave the sense  and caused  them  to understand the reading   
   and nehemiah  which  is  the tirshatha  and ezra the priest the scribe  and the levites that taught the people  said unto all the people  this day  is  holy unto the lord your god  mourn not  nor weep  for all the people wept  when they heard the words of the law   
   then he said unto them  go your way  eat the fat  and drink the sweet  and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared  for  this  day  is  holy unto our lord  neither be ye sorry  for the joy of the lord is your strength   
   so the levites stilled all the people  saying  hold your peace  for the day  is  holy  neither be ye grieved   
   and all the people went their way to eat  and to drink  and to send portions  and to make great mirth  because they had understood the words that were declared unto them   
    and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people  the priests  and the levites  unto ezra the scribe  even to understand the words of the law   
   and they found written in the law which the lord had commanded by moses  that the children of israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month   
   and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities  and in jerusalem  saying  go forth unto the mount  and fetch olive branches  and pine branches  and myrtle branches  and palm branches  and branches of thick trees  to make booths  as  it is  written   
   so the people went forth  and brought  them   and made themselves booths  every one upon the roof of his house  and in their courts  and in the courts of the house of god  and in the street of the water gate  and in the street of the gate of ephraim   
   and all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths  and sat under the booths  for since the days of jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of israel done so  and there was very great gladness   
   also day by day  from the first day unto the last day  he read in the book of the law of god  and they kept the feast seven days  and on the eighth day  was  a solemn assembly  according unto the manner   
nehemiah   
   now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of israel were assembled with fasting  and with sackclothes  and earth upon them   
  and the seed of israel separated themselves from all strangers  and stood and confessed their sins  and the iniquities of their fathers   
  and they stood up in their place  and read in the book of the law of the lord their god  one  fourth part of the day  and  another  fourth part they confessed  and worshipped the lord their god   
   then stood up upon the stairs  of the levites  jeshua  and bani  kadmiel  shebaniah  bunni  sherebiah  bani   and  chenani  and cried with a loud voice unto the lord their god   
  then the levites  jeshua  and kadmiel  bani  hashabniah  sherebiah  hodijah  shebaniah   and  pethahiah  said  stand up  and  bless the lord your god for ever and ever  and blessed be thy glorious name  which is exalted above all blessing and praise   
  thou   even  thou   art  lord alone  thou hast made heaven  the heaven of heavens  with all their host  the earth  and all  things  that  are  therein  the seas  and all that  is  therein  and thou preservest them all  and the host of heaven worshippeth thee   
  thou  art  the lord the god  who didst choose abram  and broughtest him forth out of ur of the chaldees  and gavest him the name of abraham   
  and foundest his heart faithful before thee  and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the canaanites  the hittites  the amorites  and the perizzites  and the jebusites  and the girgashites  to give  it  i say   to his seed  and hast performed thy words  for thou  art  righteous   
  and didst see the affliction of our fathers in egypt  and heardest their cry by the red sea   
   and shewedst signs and wonders upon pharaoh  and on all his servants  and on all the people of his land  for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them  so didst thou get thee a name  as  it is  this day   
   and thou didst divide the sea before them  so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land  and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps  as a stone into the mighty waters   
   moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar  and in the night by a pillar of fire  to give them light in the way wherein they should go   
   thou camest down also upon mount sinai  and spakest with them from heaven  and gavest them right judgments  and true laws  good statutes and commandments   
   and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath  and commandedst them precepts  statutes  and laws  by the hand of moses thy servant   
   and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger  and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst  and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them   
   but they and our fathers dealt proudly  and hardened their necks  and hearkened not to thy commandments   
   and refused to obey  neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them  but hardened their necks  and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage  but thou  art  a god ready to pardon  gracious and merciful  slow to anger  and of great kindness  and forsookest them not   
   yea  when they had made them a molten calf  and said  this  is  thy god that brought thee up out of egypt  and had wrought great provocations   
   yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness  the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day  to lead them in the way  neither the pillar of fire by night  to shew them light  and the way wherein they should go   
   thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them  and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth  and gavest them water for their thirst   
   yea  forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness   so that  they lacked nothing  their clothes waxed not old  and their feet swelled not   
   moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations  and didst divide them into corners  so they possessed the land of sihon  and the land of the king of heshbon  and the land of og king of bashan   
   their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven  and broughtest them into the land  concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers  that they should go in to possess  it    
   so the children went in and possessed the land  and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land  the canaanites  and gavest them into their hands  with their kings  and the people of the land  that they might do with them as they would   
   and they took strong cities  and a fat land  and possessed houses full of all goods  wells digged  vineyards  and oliveyards  and fruit trees in abundance  so they did eat  and were filled  and became fat  and delighted themselves in thy great goodness   
   nevertheless they were disobedient  and rebelled against thee  and cast thy law behind their backs  and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee  and they wrought great provocations   
   therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies  who vexed them  and in the time of their trouble  when they cried unto thee  thou heardest  them  from heaven  and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours  who saved them out of the hand of their enemies   
   but after they had rest  they did evil again before thee  therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies  so that they had the dominion over them  yet when they returned  and cried unto thee  thou heardest  them  from heaven  and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies   
   and testifiedst against them  that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law  yet they dealt proudly  and hearkened not unto thy commandments  but sinned against thy judgments   which if a man do  he shall live in them   and withdrew the shoulder  and hardened their neck  and would not hear   
   yet many years didst thou forbear them  and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets  yet would they not give ear  therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands   
   nevertheless for thy great mercies  sake thou didst not utterly consume them  nor forsake them  for thou  art  a gracious and merciful god   
   now therefore  our god  the great  the mighty  and the terrible god  who keepest covenant and mercy  let not all the trouble seem little before thee  that hath come upon us  on our kings  on our princes  and on our priests  and on our prophets  and on our fathers  and on all thy people  since the time of the kings of assyria unto this day   
   howbeit thou  art  just in all that is brought upon us  for thou hast done right  but we have done wickedly   
   neither have our kings  our princes  our priests  nor our fathers  kept thy law  nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies  wherewith thou didst testify against them   
   for they have not served thee in their kingdom  and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them  and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them  neither turned they from their wicked works   
   behold  we  are  servants this day  and  for  the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof  behold  we  are  servants in it   
   and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins  also they have dominion over our bodies  and over our cattle  at their pleasure  and we  are  in great distress   
   and because of all this we make a sure  covenant   and write  it   and our princes  levites   and  priests  seal  unto it

   and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land  nor take their daughters for our sons   
   and  if  the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell   that  we would not buy it of them on the sabbath  or on the holy day  and  that  we would leave the seventh year  and the exaction of every debt   
    also we made ordinances for us  to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our god   
   for the shewbread  and for the continual meat offering  and for the continual burnt offering  of the sabbaths  of the new moons  for the set feasts  and for the holy  things   and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for israel  and  for  all the work of the house of our god   
   and we cast the lots among the priests  the levites  and the people  for the wood offering  to bring  it  into the house of our god  after the houses of our fathers  at times appointed year by year  to burn upon the altar of the lord our god  as  it is  written in the law   
   and to bring the firstfruits of our ground  and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees  year by year  unto the house of the lord   
   also the firstborn of our sons  and of our cattle  as  it is  written in the law  and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks  to bring to the house of our god  unto the priests that minister in the house of our god   
   and  that  we should bring the firstfruits of our dough  and our offerings  and the fruit of all manner of trees  of wine and of oil  unto the priests  to the chambers of the house of our god  and the tithes of our ground unto the levites  that the same levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage   
   and the priest the son of aaron shall be with the levites  when the levites take tithes  and the levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our god  to the chambers  into the treasure house   
   for the children of israel and the children of levi shall bring the offering of the corn  of the new wine  and the oil  unto the chambers  where  are  the vessels of the sanctuary  and the priests that minister  and the porters  and the singers  and we will not forsake the house of our god

   the levites in the days of eliashib  joiada  and johanan  and jaddua   were  recorded chief of the fathers  also the priests  to the reign of darius the persian   
   the sons of levi  the chief of the fathers   were  written in the book of the chronicles  even until the days of johanan the son of eliashib   
   and the chief of the levites  hashabiah  sherebiah  and jeshua the son of kadmiel  with their brethren over against them  to praise  and  to give thanks  according to the commandment of david the man of god  ward over against ward   
   mattaniah  and bakbukiah  obadiah  meshullam  talmon  akkub   were  porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates   
   these  were  in the days of joiakim the son of jeshua  the son of jozadak  and in the days of nehemiah the governor  and of ezra the priest  the scribe   
    and at the dedication of the wall of jerusalem they sought the levites out of all their places  to bring them to jerusalem  to keep the dedication with gladness  both with thanksgivings  and with singing   with  cymbals  psalteries  and with harps   
   and the sons of the singers gathered themselves together  both out of the plain country round about jerusalem  and from the villages of netophathi   
   also from the house of gilgal  and out of the fields of geba and azmaveth  for the singers had builded them villages round about jerusalem   
   and the priests and the levites purified themselves  and purified the people  and the gates  and the wall   
   then i brought up the princes of judah upon the wall  and appointed two great  companies of them that gave  thanks   whereof one  went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate   
   and after them went hoshaiah  and half of the princes of judah   
   and azariah  ezra  and meshullam   
   judah  and benjamin  and shemaiah  and jeremiah   
   and  certain  of the priests  sons with trumpets   namely   zechariah the son of jonathan  the son of shemaiah  the son of mattaniah  the son of michaiah  the son of zaccur  the son of asaph   
   and his brethren  shemaiah  and azarael  milalai  gilalai  maai  nethaneel  and judah  hanani  with the musical instruments of david the man of god  and ezra the scribe before them   
   and at the fountain gate  which was over against them  they went up by the stairs of the city of david  at the going up of the wall  above the house of david  even unto the water gate eastward   
   and the other  company of them that gave  thanks went over against  them   and i after them  and the half of the people upon the wall  from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall   
   and from above the gate of ephraim  and above the old gate  and above the fish gate  and the tower of hananeel  and the tower of meah  even unto the sheep gate  and they stood still in the prison gate   
   so stood the two  companies of them that gave  thanks in the house of god  and i  and the half of the rulers with me   
   and the priests  eliakim  maaseiah  miniamin  michaiah  elioenai  zechariah   and  hananiah  with trumpets   
   and maaseiah  and shemaiah  and eleazar  and uzzi  and jehohanan  and malchijah  and elam  and ezer  and the singers sang loud  with jezrahiah  their  overseer   
   also that day they offered great sacrifices  and rejoiced  for god had made them rejoice with great joy  the wives also and the children rejoiced  so that the joy of jerusalem was heard even afar off   
    and at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures  for the offerings  for the firstfruits  and for the tithes  to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and levites  for judah rejoiced for the priests and for the levites that waited   
   and both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their god  and the ward of the purification  according to the commandment of david   and  of solomon his son   
   for in the days of david and asaph of old  there were  chief of the singers  and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto god   
   and all israel in the days of zerubbabel  and in the days of nehemiah  gave the portions of the singers and the porters  every day his portion  and they sanctified  holy things  unto the levites  and the levites sanctified  them  unto the children of aaron   
nehemiah    
   on that day they read in the book of moses in the audience of the people  and therein was found written  that the ammonite and the moabite should not come into the congregation of god for ever   
  because they met not the children of israel with bread and with water  but hired balaam against them  that he should curse them  howbeit our god turned the curse into a blessing   
  now it came to pass  when they had heard the law  that they separated from israel all the mixed multitude   
  and before this  eliashib the priest  having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our god   was  allied unto tobiah   
  and he had prepared for him a great chamber  where aforetime they laid the meat offerings  the frankincense  and the vessels  and the tithes of the corn  the new wine  and the oil  which was commanded  to be given  to the levites  and the singers  and the porters  and the offerings of the priests   
  but in all this  time  was not i at jerusalem  for in the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon came i unto the king  and after certain days obtained i leave of the king   
  and i came to jerusalem  and understood of the evil that eliashib did for tobiah  in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of god   
  and it grieved me sore  therefore i cast forth all the household stuff of tobiah out of the chamber   
  then i commanded  and they cleansed the chambers  and thither brought i again the vessels of the house of god  with the meat offering and the frankincense   
    and i perceived that the portions of the levites had not been given  them   for the levites and the singers  that did the work  were fled every one to his field   
   then contended i with the rulers  and said  why is the house of god forsaken  and i gathered them together  and set them in their place   
   then brought all judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries   
   and i made treasurers over the treasuries  shelemiah the priest  and zadok the scribe  and of the levites  pedaiah  and next to them  was  hanan the son of zaccur  the son of mattaniah  for they were counted faithful  and their office  was  to distribute unto their brethren   
   remember me  o my god  concerning this  and wipe not out my good deeds that i have done for the house of my god  and for the offices thereof   
    in those days saw i in judah  some  treading wine presses on the sabbath  and bringing in sheaves  and lading asses  as also wine  grapes  and figs  and all  manner of  burdens  which they brought into jerusalem on the sabbath day  and i testified  against them  in the day wherein they sold victuals   
   there dwelt men of tyre also therein  which brought fish  and all manner of ware  and sold on the sabbath unto the children of judah  and in jerusalem   
   then i contended with the nobles of judah  and said unto them  what evil thing  is  this that ye do  and profane the sabbath day   
   did not your fathers thus  and did not our god bring all this evil upon us  and upon this city  yet ye bring more wrath upon israel by profaning the sabbath   
   and it came to pass  that when the gates of jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath  i commanded that the gates should be shut  and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath  and  some  of my servants set i at the gates   that  there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day   
   so the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without jerusalem once or twice   
   then i testified against them  and said unto them  why lodge ye about the wall  if ye do  so  again  i will lay hands on you  from that time forth came they no  more  on the sabbath   
   and i commanded the levites that they should cleanse themselves  and  that  they should come  and  keep the gates  to sanctify the sabbath day  remember me  o my god   concerning  this also  and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy   
    in those days also saw i jews  that  had married wives of ashdod  of ammon   and  of moab   
   and their children spake half in the speech of ashdod  and could not speak in the jews  language  but according to the language of each people   
   and i contended with them  and cursed them  and smote certain of them  and plucked off their hair  and made them swear by god   saying   ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons  nor take their daughters unto your sons  or for yourselves   
   did not solomon king of israel sin by these things  yet among many nations was there no king like him  who was beloved of his god  and god made him king over all israel  nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin   
   shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil  to transgress against our god in marrying strange wives   
   and  one  of the sons of joiada  the son of eliashib the high priest   was  son in law to sanballat the horonite  therefore i chased him from me   
   remember them  o my god  because they have defiled the priesthood  and the covenant of the priesthood  and of the levites   
   thus cleansed i them from all strangers  and appointed the wards of the priests and the levites  every one in his business   
   and for the wood offering  at times appointed  and for the firstfruits  remember me  o my god  for good

   now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus   this  is  ahasuerus which reigned  from india even unto ethiopia   over  an hundred and seven and twenty provinces    
   that  in those days  when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom  which  was  in shushan the palace   
  in the third year of his reign  he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants  the power of persia and media  the nobles and princes of the provinces   being  before him   
  when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days   even  an hundred and fourscore days   
  and when these days were expired  the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace  both unto great and small  seven days  in the court of the garden of the king s palace   
   where were  white  green  and blue   hangings   fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble  the beds  were of  gold and silver  upon a pavement of red  and blue  and white  and black  marble   
  and they gave  them  drink in vessels of gold   the vessels being diverse one from another   and royal wine in abundance  according to the state of the king   
  and the drinking  was  according to the law  none did compel  for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house  that they should do according to every man s pleasure   
  also vashti the queen made a feast for the women  in  the royal house which  belonged  to king ahasuerus   
    on the seventh day  when the heart of the king was merry with wine  he commanded mehuman  biztha  harbona  bigtha  and abagtha  zethar  and carcas  the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of ahasuerus the king   
   to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal  to shew the people and the princes her beauty  for she  was  fair to look on   
   but the queen vashti refused to come at the king s commandment by  his  chamberlains  therefore was the king very wroth  and his anger burned in him   
   then the king said to the wise men  which knew the times   for so  was  the king s manner toward all that knew law and judgment   
   and the next unto him  was  carshena  shethar  admatha  tarshish  meres  marsena   and  memucan  the seven princes of persia and media  which saw the king s face   and  which sat the first in the kingdom    
   what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law  because she hath not performed the commandment of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlains   
   and memucan answered before the king and the princes  vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only  but also to all the princes  and to all the people that  are  in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus   
   for  this  deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women  so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes  when it shall be reported  the king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him  but she came not   
    likewise  shall the ladies of persia and media say this day unto all the king s princes  which have heard of the deed of the queen  thus  shall there arise  too much contempt and wrath   
   if it please the king  let there go a royal commandment from him  and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes  that it be not altered  that vashti come no more before king ahasuerus  and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she   
   and when the king s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire   for it is great   all the wives shall give to their husbands honour  both to great and small   
   and the saying pleased the king and the princes  and the king did according to the word of memucan   
   for he sent letters into all the king s provinces  into every province according to the writing thereof  and to every people after their language  that every man should bear rule in his own house  and that  it  should be published according to the language of every people   
esther   
   after these things  when the wrath of king ahasuerus was appeased  he remembered vashti  and what she had done  and what was decreed against her   
  then said the king s servants that ministered unto him  let there be fair young virgins sought for the king   
  and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom  that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shushan the palace  to the house of the women  unto the custody of hege the king s chamberlain  keeper of the women  and let their things for purification be given  them    
  and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti  and the thing pleased the king  and he did so   
   now  in shushan the palace there was a certain jew  whose name  was  mordecai  the son of jair  the son of shimei  the son of kish  a benjamite   
  who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah  whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away   
  and he brought up hadassah  that  is   esther  his uncle s daughter  for she had neither father nor mother  and the maid  was  fair and beautiful  whom mordecai  when her father and mother were dead  took for his own daughter   
  so it came to pass  when the king s commandment and his decree was heard  and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace  to the custody of hegai  that esther was brought also unto the king s house  to the custody of hegai  keeper of the women   
  and the maiden pleased him  and she obtained kindness of him  and he speedily gave her her things for purification  with such things as belonged to her  and seven maidens   which were  meet to be given her  out of the king s house  and he preferred her and her maids unto the best  place  of the house of the women   
   esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred  for mordecai had charged her that she should not shew  it    
   and mordecai walked every day before the court of the women s house  to know how esther did  and what should become of her   
   now when every maid s turn was come to go in to king ahasuerus  after that she had been twelve months  according to the manner of the women   for so were the days of their purifications accomplished   to wit   six months with oil of myrrh  and six months with sweet odours  and with  other  things for the purifying of the women    
   then thus came  every  maiden unto the king  whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king s house   
   in the evening she went  and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women  to the custody of shaashgaz  the king s chamberlain  which kept the concubines  she came in unto the king no more  except the king delighted in her  and that she were called by name   
   now when the turn of esther  the daughter of abihail the uncle of mordecai  who had taken her for his daughter  was come to go in unto the king  she required nothing but what hegai the king s chamberlain  the keeper of the women  appointed  and esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her   
   so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month  which  is  the month tebeth  in the seventh year of his reign   
   and the king loved esther above all the women  and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins  so that he set the royal crown upon her head  and made her queen instead of vashti   
   then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants   even  esther s feast  and he made a release to the provinces  and gave gifts  according to the state of the king   
   and when the virgins were gathered together the second time  then mordecai sat in the king s gate   
   esther had not  yet  shewed her kindred nor her people  as mordecai had charged her  for esther did the commandment of mordecai  like as when she was brought up with him   
    in those days  while mordecai sat in the king s gate  two of the king s chamberlains  bigthan and teresh  of those which kept the door  were wroth  and sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus   
   and the thing was known to mordecai  who told  it  unto esther the queen  and esther certified the king  thereof  in mordecai s name   
   and when inquisition was made of the matter  it was found out  therefore they were both hanged on a tree  and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king   
esther   
   after these things did king ahasuerus promote haman the son of hammedatha the agagite  and advanced him  and set his seat above all the princes that  were  with him   
  and all the king s servants  that  were  in the king s gate  bowed  and reverenced haman  for the king had so commanded concerning him  but mordecai bowed not  nor did  him  reverence   
  then the king s servants  which  were  in the king s gate  said unto mordecai  why transgressest thou the king s commandment   
  now it came to pass  when they spake daily unto him  and he hearkened not unto them  that they told haman  to see whether mordecai s matters would stand  for he had told them that he  was  a jew   
  and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not  nor did him reverence  then was haman full of wrath   
  and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone  for they had shewed him the people of mordecai  wherefore haman sought to destroy all the jews that  were  throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus   even  the people of mordecai   
   in the first month  that  is   the month nisan  in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus  they cast pur  that  is   the lot  before haman from day to day  and from month to month   to  the twelfth  month   that  is   the month adar   
  and haman said unto king ahasuerus  there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom  and their laws  are  diverse from all people  neither keep they the king s laws  therefore it  is  not for the king s profit to suffer them   
  if it please the king  let it be written that they may be destroyed  and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business  to bring  it  into the king s treasuries   
   and the king took his ring from his hand  and gave it unto haman the son of hammedatha the agagite  the jews  enemy   
   and the king said unto haman  the silver  is  given to thee  the people also  to do with them as it seemeth good to thee   
   then were the king s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month  and there was written according to all that haman had commanded unto the king s lieutenants  and to the governors that  were  over every province  and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof  and  to  every people after their language  in the name of king ahasuerus was it written  and sealed with the king s ring   
   and the letters were sent by posts into all the king s provinces  to destroy  to kill  and to cause to perish  all jews  both young and old  little children and women  in one day   even  upon the thirteenth  day  of the twelfth month  which is the month adar  and  to take  the spoil of them for a prey   
   the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people  that they should be ready against that day   
   the posts went out  being hastened by the king s commandment  and the decree was given in shushan the palace  and the king and haman sat down to drink  but the city shushan was perplexed   
esther   
   when mordecai perceived all that was done  mordecai rent his clothes  and put on sackcloth with ashes  and went out into the midst of the city  and cried with a loud and a bitter cry   
  and came even before the king s gate  for none  might  enter into the king s gate clothed with sackcloth   
  and in every province  whithersoever the king s commandment and his decree came   there was  great mourning among the jews  and fasting  and weeping  and wailing  and many lay in sackcloth and ashes   
  so esther s maids and her chamberlains came and told  it  her  then was the queen exceedingly grieved  and she sent raiment to clothe mordecai  and to take away his sackcloth from him  but he received  it  not   
   then called esther for hatach   one  of the king s chamberlains  whom he had appointed to attend upon her  and gave him a commandment to mordecai  to know what it  was   and why it  was    
  so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the city  which  was  before the king s gate   
  and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him  and of the sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the king s treasuries for the jews  to destroy them   
  also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at shushan to destroy them  to shew  it  unto esther  and to declare  it  unto her  and to charge her that she should go in unto the king  to make supplication unto him  and to make request before him for her people   
  and hatach came and told esther the words of mordecai   
   again esther spake unto hatach  and gave him commandment unto mordecai   
   all the king s servants  and the people of the king s provinces  do know  that whosoever  whether man or woman  shall come unto the king into the inner court  who is not called   there is  one law of his to put  him  to death  except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre  that he may live  but i have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days   
   and they told to mordecai esther s words   
   then mordecai commanded to answer esther  think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king s house  more than all the jews   
   for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time   then  shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place  but thou and thy father s house shall be destroyed  and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for  such  a time as this   
   then esther bade  them  return mordecai  this answer    
   go  gather together all the jews that are present in shushan  and fast ye for me  and neither eat nor drink three days  night or day  i also and my maidens will fast likewise  and so will i go in unto the king  which  is  not according to the law  and if i perish  i perish   
   so mordecai went his way  and did according to all that esther had commanded him   
esther   
   now it came to pass on the third day  that esther put on  her  royal  apparel   and stood in the inner court of the king s house  over against the king s house  and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house  over against the gate of the house   
  and it was so  when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court   that  she obtained favour in his sight  and the king held out to esther the golden sceptre that  was  in his hand  so esther drew near  and touched the top of the sceptre   
  then said the king unto her  what wilt thou  queen esther  and what  is  thy request  it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom   
  and esther answered  if  it seem  good unto the king  let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him   
  then the king said  cause haman to make haste  that he may do as esther hath said  so the king and haman came to the banquet that esther had prepared   
  and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine  what  is  thy petition  and it shall be granted thee  and what  is  thy request  even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed   
  then answered esther  and said  my petition and my request  is    
  if i have found favour in the sight of the king  and if it please the king to grant my petition  and to perform my request  let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them  and i will do to morrow as the king hath said   
   then went haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart  but when haman saw mordecai in the king s gate  that he stood not up  nor moved for him  he was full of indignation against mordecai   
   nevertheless haman refrained himself  and when he came home  he sent and called for his friends  and zeresh his wife   
   and haman told them of the glory of his riches  and the multitude of his children  and all  the things  wherein the king had promoted him  and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king   
   haman said moreover  yea  esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself  and to morrow am i invited unto her also with the king   
   yet all this availeth me nothing  so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the king s gate   
   then said zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him  let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high  and to morrow speak thou unto the king that mordecai may be hanged thereon  then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet  and the thing pleased haman  and he caused the gallows to be made   
esther   
   on that night could not the king sleep  and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles  and they were read before the king   
  and it was found written  that mordecai had told of bigthana and teresh  two of the king s chamberlains  the keepers of the door  who sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus   
  and the king said  what honour and dignity hath been done to mordecai for this  then said the king s servants that ministered unto him  there is nothing done for him   
   and the king said  who  is  in the court  now haman was come into the outward court of the king s house  to speak unto the king to hang mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him   
  and the king s servants said unto him  behold  haman standeth in the court  and the king said  let him come in   
  so haman came in  and the king said unto him  what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour  now haman thought in his heart  to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself   
  and haman answered the king  for the man whom the king delighteth to honour   
  let the royal apparel be brought which the king  useth  to wear  and the horse that the king rideth upon  and the crown royal which is set upon his head   
  and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king s most noble princes  that they may array the man  withal  whom the king delighteth to honour  and bring him on horseback through the street of the city  and proclaim before him  thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour   
   then the king said to haman  make haste   and  take the apparel and the horse  as thou hast said  and do even so to mordecai the jew  that sitteth at the king s gate  let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken   
   then took haman the apparel and the horse  and arrayed mordecai  and brought him on horseback through the street of the city  and proclaimed before him  thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour   
    and mordecai came again to the king s gate  but haman hasted to his house mourning  and having his head covered   
   and haman told zeresh his wife and all his friends every  thing  that had befallen him  then said his wise men and zeresh his wife unto him  if mordecai  be  of the seed of the jews  before whom thou hast begun to fall  thou shalt not prevail against him  but shalt surely fall before him   
   and while they  were  yet talking with him  came the king s chamberlains  and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther had prepared   
esther   
   so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen   
  and the king said again unto esther on the second day at the banquet of wine  what  is  thy petition  queen esther  and it shall be granted thee  and what  is  thy request  and it shall be performed   even  to the half of the kingdom   
  then esther the queen answered and said  if i have found favour in thy sight  o king  and if it please the king  let my life be given me at my petition  and my people at my request   
  for we are sold  i and my people  to be destroyed  to be slain  and to perish  but if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen  i had held my tongue  although the enemy could not countervail the king s damage   
  then the king ahasuerus answered and said unto esther the queen  who is he  and where is he  that durst presume in his heart to do so   
  and esther said  the adversary and enemy  is  this wicked haman  then haman was afraid before the king and the queen   
   and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath  went  into the palace garden  and haman stood up to make request for his life to esther the queen  for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king   
  then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine  and haman was fallen upon the bed whereon esther  was   then said the king  will he force the queen also before me in the house  as the word went out of the king s mouth  they covered haman s face   
  and harbonah  one of the chamberlains  said before the king  behold also  the gallows fifty cubits high  which haman had made for mordecai  who had spoken good for the king  standeth in the house of haman  then the king said  hang him thereon   
   so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai  then was the king s wrath pacified   
esther   
   on that day did the king ahasuerus give the house of haman the jews  enemy unto esther the queen  and mordecai came before the king  for esther had told what he  was  unto her   
  and the king took off his ring  which he had taken from haman  and gave it unto mordecai  and esther set mordecai over the house of haman   
   and esther spake yet again before the king  and fell down at his feet  and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite  and his device that he had devised against the jews   
  then the king held out the golden sceptre toward esther  so esther arose  and stood before the king   
  and said  if it please the king  and if i have found favour in his sight  and the thing  seem  right before the king  and i  be  pleasing in his eyes  let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite  which he wrote to destroy the jews which  are  in all the king s provinces   
  for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people  or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred   
  then the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew  behold  i have given esther the house of haman  and him they have hanged upon the gallows  because he laid his hand upon the jews   
  write ye also for the jews  as it liketh you  in the king s name  and seal  it  with the king s ring  for the writing which is written in the king s name  and sealed with the king s ring  may no man reverse   
  then were the king s scribes called at that time in the third month  that  is   the month sivan  on the three and twentieth  day  thereof  and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded unto the jews  and to the lieutenants  and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which  are  from india unto ethiopia  an hundred twenty and seven provinces  unto every province according to the writing thereof  and unto every people after their language  and to the jews according to their writing  and according to their language   
   and he wrote in the king ahasuerus  name  and sealed  it  with the king s ring  and sent letters by posts on horseback   and  riders on mules  camels   and  young dromedaries   
   wherein the king granted the jews which  were  in every city to gather themselves together  and to stand for their life  to destroy  to slay  and to cause to perish  all the power of the people and province that would assault them   both  little ones and women  and  to take  the spoil of them for a prey   
   upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus   namely   upon the thirteenth  day  of the twelfth month  which  is  the month adar   
   the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province  was  published unto all people  and that the jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies   
    so  the posts that rode upon mules  and  camels went out  being hastened and pressed on by the king s commandment  and the decree was given at shushan the palace   
    and mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white  and with a great crown of gold  and with a garment of fine linen and purple  and the city of shushan rejoiced and was glad   
   the jews had light  and gladness  and joy  and honour   
   and in every province  and in every city  whithersoever the king s commandment and his decree came  the jews had joy and gladness  a feast and a good day  and many of the people of the land became jews  for the fear of the jews fell upon them   
esther   
   now in the twelfth month  that  is   the month adar  on the thirteenth day of the same  when the king s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution  in the day that the enemies of the jews hoped to have power over them   though it was turned to the contrary  that the jews had rule over them that hated them    
  the jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king ahasuerus  to lay hand on such as sought their hurt  and no man could withstand them  for the fear of them fell upon all people   
  and all the rulers of the provinces  and the lieutenants  and the deputies  and officers of the king  helped the jews  because the fear of mordecai fell upon them   
  for mordecai  was  great in the king s house  and his fame went out throughout all the provinces  for this man mordecai waxed greater and greater   
  thus the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword  and slaughter  and destruction  and did what they would unto those that hated them   
  and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred men   
  and parshandatha  and dalphon  and aspatha   
  and poratha  and adalia  and aridatha   
  and parmashta  and arisai  and aridai  and vajezatha   
   the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha  the enemy of the jews  slew they  but on the spoil laid they not their hand   
   on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the palace was brought before the king   
   and the king said unto esther the queen  the jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in shushan the palace  and the ten sons of haman  what have they done in the rest of the king s provinces  now what  is  thy petition  and it shall be granted thee  or what  is  thy request further  and it shall be done   
   then said esther  if it please the king  let it be granted to the jews which  are  in shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day s decree  and let haman s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows   
   and the king commanded it so to be done  and the decree was given at shushan  and they hanged haman s ten sons   
   for the jews that  were  in shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month adar  and slew three hundred men at shushan  but on the prey they laid not their hand   
   but the other jews that  were  in the king s provinces gathered themselves together  and stood for their lives  and had rest from their enemies  and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand  but they laid not their hands on the prey   
   on the thirteenth day of the month adar  and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they  and made it a day of feasting and gladness   
   but the jews that  were  at shushan assembled together on the thirteenth  day  thereof  and on the fourteenth thereof  and on the fifteenth  day  of the same they rested  and made it a day of feasting and gladness   
   therefore the jews of the villages  that dwelt in the unwalled towns  made the fourteenth day of the month adar  a day of  gladness and feasting  and a good day  and of sending portions one to another   
    and mordecai wrote these things  and sent letters unto all the jews that  were  in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus   both  nigh and far   
   to stablish  this  among them  that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar  and the fifteenth day of the same  yearly   
   as the days wherein the jews rested from their enemies  and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy  and from mourning into a good day  that they should make them days of feasting and joy  and of sending portions one to another  and gifts to the poor   
   and the jews undertook to do as they had begun  and as mordecai had written unto them   
   because haman the son of hammedatha  the agagite  the enemy of all the jews  had devised against the jews to destroy them  and had cast pur  that  is   the lot  to consume them  and to destroy them   
   but when  esther  came before the king  he commanded by letters that his wicked device  which he devised against the jews  should return upon his own head  and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows   
   wherefore they called these days purim after the name of pur  therefore for all the words of this letter  and  of that  which they had seen concerning this matter  and which had come unto them   
   the jews ordained  and took upon them  and upon their seed  and upon all such as joined themselves unto them  so as it should not fail  that they would keep these two days according to their writing  and according to their  appointed  time every year   
   and  that  these days  should be  remembered and kept throughout every generation  every family  every province  and every city  and  that  these days of purim should not fail from among the jews  nor the memorial of them perish from their seed   
   then esther the queen  the daughter of abihail  and mordecai the jew  wrote with all authority  to confirm this second letter of purim   
   and he sent the letters unto all the jews  to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus   with  words of peace and truth   
   to confirm these days of purim in their times  appointed   according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had enjoined them  and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed  the matters of the fastings and their cry   
   and the decree of esther confirmed these matters of purim  and it was written in the book   
esther    
   and the king ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land  and  upon  the isles of the sea   
  and all the acts of his power and of his might  and the declaration of the greatness of mordecai  whereunto the king advanced him   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of media and persia   
  for mordecai the jew  was  next unto king ahasuerus  and great among the jews  and accepted of the multitude of his brethren  seeking the wealth of his people  and speaking peace to all his seed   
 
job 
job   
   there was a man in the land of uz  whose name  was  job  and that man was perfect and upright  and one that feared god  and eschewed evil   
  and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters   
  his substance also was seven thousand sheep  and three thousand camels  and five hundred yoke of oxen  and five hundred she asses  and a very great household  so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east   
   and his sons went and feasted  in their  houses  every one his day  and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them   
  and it was so  when the days of  their  feasting were gone about  that job sent and sanctified them  and rose up early in the morning  and offered burnt offerings  according  to the number of them all  for job said  it may be that my sons have sinned  and cursed god in their hearts  thus did job continually   
   now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord  and satan came also among them   
  and the lord said unto satan  whence comest thou  then satan answered the lord  and said  from going to and fro in the earth  and from walking up and down in it   
  and the lord said unto satan  hast thou considered my servant job  that  there is  none like him in the earth  a perfect and an upright man  one that feareth god  and escheweth evil   
  then satan answered the lord  and said  doth job fear god for nought   
   hast not thou made an hedge about him  and about his house  and about all that he hath on every side  thou hast blessed the work of his hands  and his substance is increased in the land   
   but put forth thine hand now  and touch all that he hath  and he will curse thee to thy face   
   and the lord said unto satan  behold  all that he hath  is  in thy power  only upon himself put not forth thine hand  so satan went forth from the presence of the lord   
    and there was a day when his sons and his daughters  were  eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother s house   
   and there came a messenger unto job  and said  the oxen were plowing  and the asses feeding beside them   
   and the sabeans fell  upon them   and took them away  yea  they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword  and i only am escaped alone to tell thee   
   while he  was  yet speaking  there came also another  and said  the fire of god is fallen from heaven  and hath burned up the sheep  and the servants  and consumed them  and i only am escaped alone to tell thee   
   while he  was  yet speaking  there came also another  and said  the chaldeans made out three bands  and fell upon the camels  and have carried them away  yea  and slain the servants with the edge of the sword  and i only am escaped alone to tell thee   
   while he  was  yet speaking  there came also another  and said  thy sons and thy daughters  were  eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother s house   
   and  behold  there came a great wind from the wilderness  and smote the four corners of the house  and it fell upon the young men  and they are dead  and i only am escaped alone to tell thee   
    then job arose  and rent his mantle  and shaved his head  and fell down upon the ground  and worshipped   
   and said  naked came i out of my mother s womb  and naked shall i return thither  the lord gave  and the lord hath taken away  blessed be the name of the lord   
   in all this job sinned not  nor charged god foolishly   
job   
   again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord  and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord   
  and the lord said unto satan  from whence comest thou  and satan answered the lord  and said  from going to and fro in the earth  and from walking up and down in it   
  and the lord said unto satan  hast thou considered my servant job  that  there is  none like him in the earth  a perfect and an upright man  one that feareth god  and escheweth evil  and still he holdeth fast his integrity  although thou movedst me against him  to destroy him without cause   
  and satan answered the lord  and said  skin for skin  yea  all that a man hath will he give for his life   
  but put forth thine hand now  and touch his bone and his flesh  and he will curse thee to thy face   
  and the lord said unto satan  behold  he  is  in thine hand  but save his life   
   so went satan forth from the presence of the lord  and smote job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown   
  and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal  and he sat down among the ashes   
  then said his wife unto him  dost thou still retain thine integrity  curse god  and die   
   but he said unto her  thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh  what  shall we receive good at the hand of god  and shall we not receive evil  in all this did not job sin with his lips   
    now when job s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him  they came every one from his own place  eliphaz the temanite  and bildad the shuhite  and zophar the naamathite  for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him   
   and when they lifted up their eyes afar off  and knew him not  they lifted up their voice  and wept  and they rent every one his mantle  and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven   
   so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights  and none spake a word unto him  for they saw that  his  grief was very great   
job   
   after this opened job his mouth  and cursed his day   
  and job spake  and said   
  let the day perish wherein i was born  and the night  in which  it was said  there is a man child conceived   
  let that day be darkness  let not god regard it from above  neither let the light shine upon it   
  let darkness and the shadow of death stain it  let a cloud dwell upon it  let the blackness of the day terrify it   
  as  for  that night  let darkness seize upon it  let it not be joined unto the days of the year  let it not come into the number of the months   
  lo  let that night be solitary  let no joyful voice come therein   
  let them curse it that curse the day  who are ready to raise up their mourning   
  let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark  let it look for light  but  have  none  neither let it see the dawning of the day   
   because it shut not up the doors of my  mother s  womb  nor hid sorrow from mine eyes   
    why died i not from the womb   why  did i  not  give up the ghost when i came out of the belly   
   why did the knees prevent me  or why the breasts that i should suck   
   for now should i have lain still and been quiet  i should have slept  then had i been at rest   
   with kings and counsellors of the earth  which built desolate places for themselves   
   or with princes that had gold  who filled their houses with silver   
   or as an hidden untimely birth i had not been  as infants  which  never saw light   
   there the wicked cease  from  troubling  and there the weary be at rest   
    there  the prisoners rest together  they hear not the voice of the oppressor   
   the small and great are there  and the servant  is  free from his master   
    wherefore is light given to him that is in misery  and life unto the bitter  in  soul   
   which long for death  but it  cometh  not  and dig for it more than for hid treasures   
   which rejoice exceedingly   and  are glad  when they can find the grave   
    why is light given  to a man whose way is hid  and whom god hath hedged in   
   for my sighing cometh before i eat  and my roarings are poured out like the waters   
   for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me  and that which i was afraid of is come unto me   
   i was not in safety  neither had i rest  neither was i quiet  yet trouble came   
job   
   then eliphaz the temanite answered and said   
   if  we assay to commune with thee  wilt thou be grieved  but who can withhold himself from speaking   
  behold  thou hast instructed many  and thou hast strengthened the weak hands   
  thy words have upholden him that was falling  and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees   
  but now it is come upon thee  and thou faintest  it toucheth thee  and thou art troubled   
   is  not  this  thy fear  thy confidence  thy hope  and the uprightness of thy ways   
   remember  i pray thee  who  ever  perished  being innocent  or where were the righteous cut off   
  even as i have seen  they that plow iniquity  and sow wickedness  reap the same   
  by the blast of god they perish  and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed

   shall mortal man be more just than god  shall a man be more pure than his maker   
   behold  he put no trust in his servants  and his angels he charged with folly   
   how much less  in  them that dwell in houses of clay  whose foundation  is  in the dust   which  are crushed before the moth   
   they are destroyed from morning to evening  they perish for ever without any regarding  it

    if  god will not withdraw his anger  the proud helpers do stoop under him   
    how much less shall i answer him   and  choose out my words  to reason  with him   
   whom  though i were righteous   yet  would i not answer   but  i would make supplication to my judge   
   if i had called  and he had answered me   yet  would i not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice

   they have gaped upon me with their mouth  they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully  they have gathered themselves together against me   
   god hath delivered me to the ungodly  and turned me over into the hands of the wicked   
   i was at ease  but he hath broken me asunder  he hath also taken  me  by my neck  and shaken me to pieces  and set me up for his mark   
   his archers compass me round about  he cleaveth my reins asunder  and doth not spare  he poureth out my gall upon the ground   
   he breaketh me with breach upon breach  he runneth upon me like a giant   
   i have sewed sackcloth upon my skin  and defiled my horn in the dust   
   my face is foul with weeping  and on my eyelids  is  the shadow of death

   o earth  cover not thou my blood  and let my cry have no place

   my friends scorn me   but  mine eye poureth out  tears  unto god

  the light shall be dark in his tabernacle  and his candle shall be put out with him

  the gin shall take  him  by the heel   and  the robber shall prevail against him

   his roots shall be dried up beneath  and above shall his branch be cut off   
   his remembrance shall perish from the earth  and he shall have no name in the street

   he shall neither have son nor nephew among his people  nor any remaining in his dwellings   
   they that come after  him  shall be astonied at his day  as they that went before were affrighted

  behold  i cry out of wrong  but i am not heard  i cry aloud  but  there is  no judgment   
   he hath fenced up my way that i cannot pass  and he hath set darkness in my paths   
  he hath stripped me of my glory  and taken the crown  from  my head   
   he hath destroyed me on every side  and i am gone  and mine hope hath he removed like a tree   
   he hath also kindled his wrath against me  and he counteth me unto him as  one of  his enemies   
   his troops come together  and raise up their way against me  and encamp round about my tabernacle   
   he hath put my brethren far from me  and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me   
   my kinsfolk have failed  and my familiar friends have forgotten me   
   they that dwell in mine house  and my maids  count me for a stranger  i am an alien in their sight

   my breath is strange to my wife  though i intreated for the children s  sake  of mine own body

   why do ye persecute me as god  and are not satisfied with my flesh   
    oh that my words were now written  oh that they were printed in a book   
   that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever   
   for i know  that  my redeemer liveth  and  that  he shall stand at the latter  day  upon the earth   
   and  though  after my skin  worms  destroy this  body   yet in my flesh shall i see god   
   whom i shall see for myself  and mine eyes shall behold  and not another   though  my reins be consumed within me

  knowest thou  not  this of old  since man was placed upon earth   
  that the triumphing of the wicked  is  short  and the joy of the hypocrite  but  for a moment   
  though his excellency mount up to the heavens  and his head reach unto the clouds   
   yet  he shall perish for ever like his own dung  they which have seen him shall say  where  is  he   
  he shall fly away as a dream  and shall not be found  yea  he shall be chased away as a vision of the night   
  the eye also  which  saw him shall  see him  no more  neither shall his place any more behold him   
    his children shall seek to please the poor  and his hands shall restore their goods   
   his bones are full  of the sin  of his youth  which shall lie down with him in the dust   
   though wickedness be sweet in his mouth   though  he hide it under his tongue   
    though  he spare it  and forsake it not  but keep it still within his mouth   
    yet  his meat in his bowels is turned   it is  the gall of asps within him   
   he hath swallowed down riches  and he shall vomit them up again  god shall cast them out of his belly   
   he shall suck the poison of asps  the viper s tongue shall slay him   
   he shall not see the rivers  the floods  the brooks of honey and butter   
   that which he laboured for shall he restore  and shall not swallow  it  down  according to  his  substance  shall  the restitution  be   and he shall not rejoice  therein    
   because he hath oppressed  and  hath forsaken the poor   because  he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not   
   surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly  he shall not save of that which he desired   
   there shall none of his meat be left  therefore shall no man look for his goods   
   in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits  every hand of the wicked shall come upon him   
     when  he is about to fill his belly   god  shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him  and shall rain  it  upon him while he is eating   
   he shall flee from the iron weapon   and  the bow of steel shall strike him through   
   it is drawn  and cometh out of the body  yea  the glittering sword cometh out of his gall  terrors  are  upon him   
   all darkness  shall be  hid in his secret places  a fire not blown shall consume him  it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle   
   the heaven shall reveal his iniquity  and the earth shall rise up against him   
   the increase of his house shall depart   and his goods  shall flow away in the day of his wrath

   they take the timbrel and harp  and rejoice at the sound of the organ   
   they spend their days in wealth  and in a moment go down to the grave   
   therefore they say unto god  depart from us  for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways   
   what  is  the almighty  that we should serve him  and what profit should we have  if we pray unto him   
   lo  their good  is  not in their hand  the counsel of the wicked is far from me   
    how oft is the candle of the wicked put out  and  how oft  cometh their destruction upon them   god  distributeth sorrows in his anger

   god layeth up his iniquity for his children  he rewardeth him  and he shall know  it

   shall  any  teach god knowledge  seeing he judgeth those that are high   
   one dieth in his full strength  being wholly at ease and quiet   
   his breasts are full of milk  and his bones are moistened with marrow   
   and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul  and never eateth with pleasure

   that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction  they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath   
   who shall declare his way to his face  and who shall repay him  what  he hath done   
   yet shall he be brought to the grave  and shall remain in the tomb   
   the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him  and every man shall draw after him  as  there are  innumerable before him

  can a man be profitable unto god  as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself   
   is it  any pleasure to the almighty  that thou art righteous  or  is it  gain  to him   that thou makest thy ways perfect   
  will he reprove thee for fear of thee  will he enter with thee into judgment   
    is  not thy wickedness great  and thine iniquities infinite

  thou hast not given water to the weary to drink  and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry   
  but  as for  the mighty man  he had the earth  and the honourable man dwelt in it   
  thou hast sent widows away empty  and the arms of the fatherless have been broken

   which were cut down out of time  whose foundation was overflown with a flood   
   which said unto god  depart from us  and what can the almighty do for them   
   yet he filled their houses with good  things   but the counsel of the wicked is far from me

    acquaint now thyself with him  and be at peace  thereby good shall come unto thee   
   receive  i pray thee  the law from his mouth  and lay up his words in thine heart   
   if thou return to the almighty  thou shalt be built up  thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles   
   then shalt thou lay up gold as dust  and the  gold  of ophir as the stones of the brooks   
   yea  the almighty shall be thy defence  and thou shalt have plenty of silver   
   for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty  and shalt lift up thy face unto god   
   thou shalt make thy prayer unto him  and he shall hear thee  and thou shalt pay thy vows   
   thou shalt also decree a thing  and it shall be established unto thee  and the light shall shine upon thy ways   
   when  men  are cast down  then thou shalt say   there is  lifting up  and he shall save the humble person

job    
   moreover job continued his parable  and said   
  oh that i were as  in  months past  as  in  the days  when  god preserved me   
  when his candle shined upon my head   and when  by his light i walked  through  darkness   
  as i was in the days of my youth  when the secret of god  was  upon my tabernacle   
  when the almighty  was  yet with me   when  my children  were  about me   
  when i washed my steps with butter  and the rock poured me out rivers of oil   
   when i went out to the gate through the city   when  i prepared my seat in the street   
  the young men saw me  and hid themselves  and the aged arose   and  stood up   
  the princes refrained talking  and laid  their  hand on their mouth   
   the nobles held their peace  and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth   
   when the ear heard  me   then it blessed me  and when the eye saw  me   it gave witness to me   
   because i delivered the poor that cried  and the fatherless  and  him that had  none to help him   
   the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me  and i caused the widow s heart to sing for joy   
   i put on righteousness  and it clothed me  my judgment  was  as a robe and a diadem   
   i was eyes to the blind  and feet  was  i to the lame   
   i  was  a father to the poor  and the cause  which  i knew not i searched out   
   and i brake the jaws of the wicked  and plucked the spoil out of his teeth   
    then i said  i shall die in my nest  and i shall multiply  my  days as the sand   
   my root  was  spread out by the waters  and the dew lay all night upon my branch   
   my glory  was  fresh in me  and my bow was renewed in my hand   
   unto me  men  gave ear  and waited  and kept silence at my counsel   
   after my words they spake not again  and my speech dropped upon them   
   and they waited for me as for the rain  and they opened their mouth wide  as  for the latter rain   
    if  i laughed on them  they believed  it  not  and the light of my countenance they cast not down   
   i chose out their way  and sat chief  and dwelt as a king in the army  as one  that  comforteth the mourners   
job    
   but now  they that are  younger than i have me in derision  whose fathers i would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock   
  yea  whereto  might  the strength of their hands  profit  me  in whom old age was perished   
  for want and famine  they were  solitary  fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste   
  who cut up mallows by the bushes  and juniper roots  for  their meat   
  they were driven forth from among  men    they cried after them as  after  a thief    
  to dwell in the clifts of the valleys   in  caves of the earth  and  in  the rocks   
  among the bushes they brayed  under the nettles they were gathered together   
   they were  children of fools  yea  children of base men  they were viler than the earth   
  and now am i their song  yea  i am their byword   
   they abhor me  they flee far from me  and spare not to spit in my face   
   because he hath loosed my cord  and afflicted me  they have also let loose the bridle before me   
   upon  my  right  hand  rise the youth  they push away my feet  and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction   
   they mar my path  they set forward my calamity  they have no helper   
   they came  upon me  as a wide breaking in  of waters   in the desolation they rolled themselves  upon me    
    terrors are turned upon me  they pursue my soul as the wind  and my welfare passeth away as a cloud   
   and now my soul is poured out upon me  the days of affliction have taken hold upon me   
   my bones are pierced in me in the night season  and my sinews take no rest   
   by the great force  of my disease  is my garment changed  it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat   
   he hath cast me into the mire  and i am become like dust and ashes   
   i cry unto thee  and thou dost not hear me  i stand up  and thou regardest me  not    
   thou art become cruel to me  with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me   
   thou liftest me up to the wind  thou causest me to ride  upon it   and dissolvest my substance   
   for i know  that  thou wilt bring me  to  death  and  to  the house appointed for all living   
   howbeit he will not stretch out  his  hand to the grave  though they cry in his destruction   
   did not i weep for him that was in trouble  was  not  my soul grieved for the poor   
   when i looked for good  then evil came  unto me   and when i waited for light  there came darkness   
   my bowels boiled  and rested not  the days of affliction prevented me   
   i went mourning without the sun  i stood up   and  i cried in the congregation   
   i am a brother to dragons  and a companion to owls   
   my skin is black upon me  and my bones are burned with heat   
   my harp also is  turned  to mourning  and my organ into the voice of them that weep   
job    
   i made a covenant with mine eyes  why then should i think upon a maid   
  for what portion of god  is there  from above  and  what  inheritance of the almighty from on high   
   is  not destruction to the wicked  and a strange  punishment  to the workers of iniquity   
  doth not he see my ways  and count all my steps   
  if i have walked with vanity  or if my foot hath hasted to deceit   
  let me be weighed in an even balance  that god may know mine integrity   
  if my step hath turned out of the way  and mine heart walked after mine eyes  and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands   
   then  let me sow  and let another eat  yea  let my offspring be rooted out   
   if mine heart have been deceived by a woman  or  if  i have laid wait at my neighbour s door   
    then  let my wife grind unto another  and let others bow down upon her   
   for this  is  an heinous crime  yea  it  is  an iniquity  to be punished by  the judges   
   for it  is  a fire  that  consumeth to destruction  and would root out all mine increase   
   if i did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant  when they contended with me   
   what then shall i do when god riseth up  and when he visiteth  what shall i answer him   
   did not he that made me in the womb make him  and did not one fashion us in the womb   
    if i have withheld the poor from  their  desire  or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail   
   or have eaten my morsel myself alone  and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof   
    for from my youth he was brought up with me  as  with  a father  and i have guided her from my mother s womb    
   if i have seen any perish for want of clothing  or any poor without covering   
   if his loins have not blessed me  and  if  he were  not  warmed with the fleece of my sheep   
   if i have lifted up my hand against the fatherless  when i saw my help in the gate   
    then  let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade  and mine arm be broken from the bone   
   for destruction  from  god  was  a terror to me  and by reason of his highness i could not endure   
    if i have made gold my hope  or have said to the fine gold   thou art  my confidence   
   if i rejoiced because my wealth  was  great  and because mine hand had gotten much   
   if i beheld the sun when it shined  or the moon walking  in  brightness   
   and my heart hath been secretly enticed  or my mouth hath kissed my hand   
   this also  were  an iniquity  to be punished by  the judge  for i should have denied the god  that is  above   
   if i rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me  or lifted up myself when evil found him   
   neither have i suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul   
   if the men of my tabernacle said not  oh that we had of his flesh  we cannot be satisfied   
   the stranger did not lodge in the street   but  i opened my doors to the traveller   
    if i covered my transgressions as adam  by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom   
   did i fear a great multitude  or did the contempt of families terrify me  that i kept silence   and  went not out of the door   
   oh that one would hear me  behold  my desire  is  that  the almighty would answer me  and  that  mine adversary had written a book   
   surely i would take it upon my shoulder   and  bind it  as  a crown to me   
   i would declare unto him the number of my steps  as a prince would i go near unto him   
   if my land cry against me  or that the furrows likewise thereof complain   
   if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money  or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life   
   let thistles grow instead of wheat  and cockle instead of barley  the words of job are ended   
job    
   so these three men ceased to answer job  because he  was  righteous in his own eyes   
  then was kindled the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the buzite  of the kindred of ram  against job was his wrath kindled  because he justified himself rather than god   
  also against his three friends was his wrath kindled  because they had found no answer  and  yet  had condemned job   
  now elihu had waited till job had spoken  because they  were  elder than he   
  when elihu saw that  there was  no answer in the mouth of  these  three men  then his wrath was kindled   
   and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said  i  am  young  and ye  are  very old  wherefore i was afraid  and durst not shew you mine opinion   
  i said  days should speak  and multitude of years should teach wisdom   
  but  there is  a spirit in man  and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding   
  great men are not  always  wise  neither do the aged understand judgment   
   therefore i said  hearken to me  i also will shew mine opinion   
   behold  i waited for your words  i gave ear to your reasons  whilst ye searched out what to say   
   yea  i attended unto you  and  behold   there was  none of you that convinced job   or  that answered his words   
   lest ye should say  we have found out wisdom  god thrusteth him down  not man   
   now he hath not directed  his  words against me  neither will i answer him with your speeches   
    they were amazed  they answered no more  they left off speaking   
   when i had waited   for they spake not  but stood still   and  answered no more    
    i said   i will answer also my part  i also will shew mine opinion   
   for i am full of matter  the spirit within me constraineth me   
   behold  my belly  is  as wine  which  hath no vent  it is ready to burst like new bottles   
   i will speak  that i may be refreshed  i will open my lips and answer   
   let me not  i pray you  accept any man s person  neither let me give flattering titles unto man   
   for i know not to give flattering titles   in so doing  my maker would soon take me away   
job    
   wherefore  job  i pray thee  hear my speeches  and hearken to all my words   
  behold  now i have opened my mouth  my tongue hath spoken in my mouth   
  my words  shall be of  the uprightness of my heart  and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly   
  the spirit of god hath made me  and the breath of the almighty hath given me life   
  if thou canst answer me  set  thy words  in order before me  stand up   
  behold  i  am  according to thy wish in god s stead  i also am formed out of the clay   
  behold  my terror shall not make thee afraid  neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee   
   surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing  and i have heard the voice of  thy  words   saying    
  i am clean without transgression  i  am  innocent  neither  is there  iniquity in me   
   behold  he findeth occasions against me  he counteth me for his enemy   
   he putteth my feet in the stocks  he marketh all my paths   
   behold   in  this thou art not just  i will answer thee  that god is greater than man   
   why dost thou strive against him  for he giveth not account of any of his matters   
    for god speaketh once  yea twice   yet man  perceiveth it not   
   in a dream  in a vision of the night  when deep sleep falleth upon men  in slumberings upon the bed   
   then he openeth the ears of men  and sealeth their instruction   
   that he may withdraw man  from his  purpose  and hide pride from man   
   he keepeth back his soul from the pit  and his life from perishing by the sword   
    he is chastened also with pain upon his bed  and the multitude of his bones with strong  pain    
   so that his life abhorreth bread  and his soul dainty meat   
   his flesh is consumed away  that it cannot be seen  and his bones  that  were not seen stick out   
   yea  his soul draweth near unto the grave  and his life to the destroyers   
   if there be a messenger with him  an interpreter  one among a thousand  to shew unto man his uprightness   
   then he is gracious unto him  and saith  deliver him from going down to the pit  i have found a ransom   
   his flesh shall be fresher than a child s  he shall return to the days of his youth   
   he shall pray unto god  and he will be favourable unto him  and he shall see his face with joy  for he will render unto man his righteousness   
   he looketh upon men  and  if any  say  i have sinned  and perverted  that which was  right  and it profited me not   
   he will deliver his soul from going into the pit  and his life shall see the light   
    lo  all these  things  worketh god oftentimes with man   
   to bring back his soul from the pit  to be enlightened with the light of the living   
   mark well  o job  hearken unto me  hold thy peace  and i will speak   
   if thou hast any thing to say  answer me  speak  for i desire to justify thee   
   if not  hearken unto me  hold thy peace  and i shall teach thee wisdom   
job    
   furthermore elihu answered and said   
  hear my words  o ye wise  men   and give ear unto me  ye that have knowledge   
  for the ear trieth words  as the mouth tasteth meat   
  let us choose to us judgment  let us know among ourselves what  is  good   
  for job hath said  i am righteous  and god hath taken away my judgment   
  should i lie against my right  my wound  is  incurable without transgression   
  what man  is  like job   who  drinketh up scorning like water   
  which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity  and walketh with wicked men   
  for he hath said  it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with god   
    therefore hearken unto me  ye men of understanding  far be it from god   that he should do  wickedness  and  from  the almighty   that he should commit  iniquity   
   for the work of a man shall he render unto him  and cause every man to find according to  his  ways   
   yea  surely god will not do wickedly  neither will the almighty pervert judgment   
   who hath given him a charge over the earth  or who hath disposed the whole world   
   if he set his heart upon man   if  he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath   
   all flesh shall perish together  and man shall turn again unto dust   
    if now  thou hast  understanding  hear this  hearken to the voice of my words   
   shall even he that hateth right govern  and wilt thou condemn him that is most just   
    is it fit  to say to a king   thou art  wicked   and  to princes   ye are  ungodly   
    how much less to him  that accepteth not the persons of princes  nor regardeth the rich more than the poor  for they all  are  the work of his hands   
   in a moment shall they die  and the people shall be troubled at midnight  and pass away  and the mighty shall be taken away without hand   
   for his eyes  are  upon the ways of man  and he seeth all his goings   
    there is  no darkness  nor shadow of death  where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves   
   for he will not lay upon man more  than right   that he should enter into judgment with god   
   he shall break in pieces mighty men without number  and set others in their stead   
   therefore he knoweth their works  and he overturneth  them  in the night  so that they are destroyed   
   he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others   
   because they turned back from him  and would not consider any of his ways   
   so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him  and he heareth the cry of the afflicted   
   when he giveth quietness  who then can make trouble  and when he hideth  his  face  who then can behold him  whether  it be done  against a nation  or against a man only   
   that the hypocrite reign not  lest the people be ensnared   
    surely it is meet to be said unto god  i have borne  chastisement   i will not offend  any more    
    that which  i see not teach thou me  if i have done iniquity  i will do no more   
    should it be  according to thy mind  he will recompense it  whether thou refuse  or whether thou choose  and not i  therefore speak what thou knowest   
   let men of understanding tell me  and let a wise man hearken unto me   
   job hath spoken without knowledge  and his words  were  without wisdom   
   my desire  is that  job may be tried unto the end because of  his  answers for wicked men   
   for he addeth rebellion unto his sin  he clappeth  his hands  among us  and multiplieth his words against god   
job    
   elihu spake moreover  and said   
  thinkest thou this to be right   that  thou saidst  my righteousness  is  more than god s   
  for thou saidst  what advantage will it be unto thee   and   what profit shall i have   if i be cleansed  from my sin   
  i will answer thee  and thy companions with thee   
  look unto the heavens  and see  and behold the clouds  which  are higher than thou   
  if thou sinnest  what doest thou against him  or  if  thy transgressions be multiplied  what doest thou unto him   
  if thou be righteous  what givest thou him  or what receiveth he of thine hand   
  thy wickedness  may hurt  a man as thou  art   and thy righteousness  may profit  the son of man   
   by reason of the multitude of oppressions they make  the oppressed  to cry  they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty   
   but none saith  where  is  god my maker  who giveth songs in the night   
   who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth  and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven   
   there they cry  but none giveth answer  because of the pride of evil men   
   surely god will not hear vanity  neither will the almighty regard it   
    although thou sayest thou shalt not see him   yet  judgment  is  before him  therefore trust thou in him   
   but now  because  it is  not  so   he hath visited in his anger  yet he knoweth  it  not in great extremity   
   therefore doth job open his mouth in vain  he multiplieth words without knowledge   
job    
   elihu also proceeded  and said   
  suffer me a little  and i will shew thee that  i have  yet to speak on god s behalf   
  i will fetch my knowledge from afar  and will ascribe righteousness to my maker   
  for truly my words  shall  not  be  false  he that is perfect in knowledge  is  with thee   
   behold  god  is  mighty  and despiseth not  any  he is  mighty in strength  and  wisdom   
  he preserveth not the life of the wicked  but giveth right to the poor   
  he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous  but with kings  are they  on the throne  yea  he doth establish them for ever  and they are exalted   
  and if  they be  bound in fetters   and  be holden in cords of affliction   
  then he sheweth them their work  and their transgressions that they have exceeded   
   he openeth also their ear to discipline  and commandeth that they return from iniquity   
   if they obey and serve  him   they shall spend their days in prosperity  and their years in pleasures   
   but if they obey not  they shall perish by the sword  and they shall die without knowledge   
   but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath  they cry not when he bindeth them   
   they die in youth  and their life  is  among the unclean   
    he delivereth the poor in his affliction  and openeth their ears in oppression   
   even so would he have removed thee out of the strait  into  a broad place  where  there is  no straitness  and that which should be set on thy table  should be  full of fatness   
   but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked  judgment and justice take hold  on thee    
   because  there is  wrath   beware  lest he take thee away with  his  stroke  then a great ransom cannot deliver thee   
   will he esteem thy riches   no   not gold  nor all the forces of strength   
   desire not the night  when people are cut off in their place   
   take heed  regard not iniquity  for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction   
   behold  god exalteth by his power  who teacheth like him   
   who hath enjoined him his way  or who can say  thou hast wrought iniquity   
    remember that thou magnify his work  which men behold   
   every man may see it  man may behold  it  afar off   
   behold  god  is  great  and we know  him  not  neither can the number of his years be searched out   
   for he maketh small the drops of water  they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof   
   which the clouds do drop  and  distil upon man abundantly   
   also can  any  understand the spreadings of the clouds   or  the noise of his tabernacle   
   behold  he spreadeth his light upon it  and covereth the bottom of the sea   
   for by them judgeth he the people  he giveth meat in abundance   
   with clouds he covereth the light  and commandeth it  not to shine  by  the cloud  that cometh betwixt   
   the noise thereof sheweth concerning it  the cattle also concerning the vapour   
job    
   at this also my heart trembleth  and is moved out of his place   
  hear attentively the noise of his voice  and the sound  that  goeth out of his mouth   
  he directeth it under the whole heaven  and his lightning unto the ends of the earth   
  after it a voice roareth  he thundereth with the voice of his excellency  and he will not stay them when his voice is heard   
  god thundereth marvellously with his voice  great things doeth he  which we cannot comprehend   
   for he saith to the snow  be thou  on  the earth  likewise to the small rain  and to the great rain of his strength   
  he sealeth up the hand of every man  that all men may know his work   
  then the beasts go into dens  and remain in their places   
  out of the south cometh the whirlwind  and cold out of the north   
   by the breath of god frost is given  and the breadth of the waters is straitened   
   also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud  he scattereth his bright cloud   
   and it is turned round about by his counsels  that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth   
   he causeth it to come  whether for correction  or for his land  or for mercy   
    hearken unto this  o job  stand still  and consider the wondrous works of god   
   dost thou know when god disposed them  and caused the light of his cloud to shine   
   dost thou know the balancings of the clouds  the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge   
   how thy garments  are  warm  when he quieteth the earth by the south  wind    
   hast thou with him spread out the sky   which is  strong   and  as a molten looking glass   
   teach us what we shall say unto him   for  we cannot order  our speech  by reason of darkness   
   shall it be told him that i speak  if a man speak  surely he shall be swallowed up   
    and now  men  see not the bright light which  is  in the clouds  but the wind passeth  and cleanseth them   
   fair weather cometh out of the north  with god  is  terrible majesty   
    touching  the almighty  we cannot find him out   he is  excellent in power  and in judgment  and in plenty of justice  he will not afflict   
   men do therefore fear him  he respecteth not any  that are  wise of heart   
job    
   then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind  and said   
  who  is  this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge   
  gird up now thy loins like a man  for i will demand of thee  and answer thou me   
   where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth  declare  if thou hast understanding   
  who hath laid the measures thereof  if thou knowest  or who hath stretched the line upon it   
  whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened  or who laid the corner stone thereof   
  when the morning stars sang together  and all the sons of god shouted for joy   
  or  who  shut up the sea with doors  when it brake forth   as if  it had issued out of the womb   
  when i made the cloud the garment thereof  and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it   
   and brake up for it my decreed  place   and set bars and doors   
   and said  hitherto shalt thou come  but no further  and here shall thy proud waves be stayed   
    hast thou commanded the morning since thy days   and  caused the dayspring to know his place   
   that it might take hold of the ends of the earth  that the wicked might be shaken out of it   
   it is turned as clay  to  the seal  and they stand as a garment   
   and from the wicked their light is withholden  and the high arm shall be broken   
   hast thou entered into the springs of the sea  or hast thou walked in the search of the depth   
   have the gates of death been opened unto thee  or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death   
   hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth  declare if thou knowest it all   
   where  is  the way  where  light dwelleth  and  as for  darkness  where  is  the place thereof   
   that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof  and that thou shouldest know the paths  to  the house thereof   
   knowest thou  it   because thou wast then born  or  because  the number of thy days  is  great   
   hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow  or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail   
   which i have reserved against the time of trouble  against the day of battle and war   
   by what way is the light parted   which  scattereth the east wind upon the earth   
    who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters  or a way for the lightning of thunder   
   to cause it to rain on the earth   where  no man  is  on  the wilderness  wherein  there is  no man   
   to satisfy the desolate and waste  ground   and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth   
   hath the rain a father  or who hath begotten the drops of dew   
   out of whose womb came the ice  and the hoary frost of heaven  who hath gendered it   
   the waters are hid as  with  a stone  and the face of the deep is frozen   
   canst thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades  or loose the bands of orion   
   canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in his season  or canst thou guide arcturus with his sons   
   knowest thou the ordinances of heaven  canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth   
   canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds  that abundance of waters may cover thee   
   canst thou send lightnings  that they may go  and say unto thee  here we  are    
   who hath put wisdom in the inward parts  or who hath given understanding to the heart   
   who can number the clouds in wisdom  or who can stay the bottles of heaven   
   when the dust groweth into hardness  and the clods cleave fast together   
   wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion  or fill the appetite of the young lions   
   when they couch in  their  dens   and  abide in the covert to lie in wait   
   who provideth for the raven his food  when his young ones cry unto god  they wander for lack of meat   
job    
   knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth   or  canst thou mark when the hinds do calve   
  canst thou number the months  that  they fulfil  or knowest thou the time when they bring forth   
  they bow themselves  they bring forth their young ones  they cast out their sorrows   
  their young ones are in good liking  they grow up with corn  they go forth  and return not unto them   
  who hath sent out the wild ass free  or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass   
  whose house i have made the wilderness  and the barren land his dwellings   
  he scorneth the multitude of the city  neither regardeth he the crying of the driver   
  the range of the mountains  is  his pasture  and he searcheth after every green thing   
  will the unicorn be willing to serve thee  or abide by thy crib   
   canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow  or will he harrow the valleys after thee   
   wilt thou trust him  because his strength  is  great  or wilt thou leave thy labour to him   
   wilt thou believe him  that he will bring home thy seed  and gather  it into  thy barn   
     gavest thou  the goodly wings unto the peacocks  or wings and feathers unto the ostrich   
   which leaveth her eggs in the earth  and warmeth them in dust   
   and forgetteth that the foot may crush them  or that the wild beast may break them   
   she is hardened against her young ones  as though  they were  not hers  her labour is in vain without fear   
   because god hath deprived her of wisdom  neither hath he imparted to her understanding   
   what time she lifteth up herself on high  she scorneth the horse and his rider   
    hast thou given the horse strength  hast thou clothed his neck with thunder   
   canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper  the glory of his nostrils  is  terrible   
   he paweth in the valley  and rejoiceth in  his  strength  he goeth on to meet the armed men   
   he mocketh at fear  and is not affrighted  neither turneth he back from the sword   
   the quiver rattleth against him  the glittering spear and the shield   
   he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage  neither believeth he that  it is  the sound of the trumpet   
   he saith among the trumpets  ha  ha  and he smelleth the battle afar off  the thunder of the captains  and the shouting   
    doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom   and  stretch her wings toward the south   
   doth the eagle mount up at thy command  and make her nest on high   
   she dwelleth and abideth on the rock  upon the crag of the rock  and the strong place   
   from thence she seeketh the prey   and  her eyes behold afar off   
   her young ones also suck up blood  and where the slain  are   there  is  she   
job    
   moreover the lord answered job  and said   
  shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct  him   he that reproveth god  let him answer it   
  then job answered the lord  and said   
  behold  i am vile  what shall i answer thee  i will lay mine hand upon my mouth   
  once have i spoken  but i will not answer  yea  twice  but i will proceed no further   
   then answered the lord unto job out of the whirlwind  and said   
  gird up thy loins now like a man  i will demand of thee  and declare thou unto me   
  wilt thou also disannul my judgment  wilt thou condemn me  that thou mayest be righteous   
  hast thou an arm like god  or canst thou thunder with a voice like him   
   deck thyself now  with  majesty and excellency  and array thyself with glory and beauty   
   cast abroad the rage of thy wrath  and behold every one  that is  proud  and abase him   
   look on every one  that is  proud   and  bring him low  and tread down the wicked in their place   
   hide them in the dust together   and  bind their faces in secret   
   then will i also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee   
    behold now behemoth  which i made with thee  he eateth grass as an ox   
   lo now  his strength  is  in his loins  and his force  is  in the navel of his belly   
   he moveth his tail like a cedar  the sinews of his stones are wrapped together   
   his bones  are as  strong pieces of brass  his bones  are  like bars of iron   
   he  is  the chief of the ways of god  he that made him can make his sword to approach  unto him    
   surely the mountains bring him forth food  where all the beasts of the field play   
   he lieth under the shady trees  in the covert of the reed  and fens   
   the shady trees cover him  with  their shadow  the willows of the brook compass him about   
   behold  he drinketh up a river   and  hasteth not  he trusteth that he can draw up jordan into his mouth   
   he taketh it with his eyes   his  nose pierceth through snares   
job    
   canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook  or his tongue with a cord  which  thou lettest down   
  canst thou put an hook into his nose  or bore his jaw through with a thorn   
  will he make many supplications unto thee  will he speak soft  words  unto thee   
  will he make a covenant with thee  wilt thou take him for a servant for ever   
  wilt thou play with him as  with  a bird  or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens   
  shall the companions make a banquet of him  shall they part him among the merchants   
  canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons  or his head with fish spears   
  lay thine hand upon him  remember the battle  do no more   
  behold  the hope of him is in vain  shall not  one  be cast down even at the sight of him   
   none  is so  fierce that dare stir him up  who then is able to stand before me   
    who hath prevented me  that i should repay  him  whatsoever is  under the whole heaven is mine   
   i will not conceal his parts  nor his power  nor his comely proportion   
   who can discover the face of his garment   or  who can come  to him  with his double bridle   
   who can open the doors of his face  his teeth  are  terrible round about   
    his  scales  are his  pride  shut up together  as with  a close seal   
   one is so near to another  that no air can come between them   
   they are joined one to another  they stick together  that they cannot be sundered   
   by his neesings a light doth shine  and his eyes  are  like the eyelids of the morning   
   out of his mouth go burning lamps   and  sparks of fire leap out   
   out of his nostrils goeth smoke  as  out  of a seething pot or caldron   
   his breath kindleth coals  and a flame goeth out of his mouth   
   in his neck remaineth strength  and sorrow is turned into joy before him   
   the flakes of his flesh are joined together  they are firm in themselves  they cannot be moved   
   his heart is as firm as a stone  yea  as hard as a piece of the nether  millstone    
   when he raiseth up himself  the mighty are afraid  by reason of breakings they purify themselves   
   the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold  the spear  the dart  nor the habergeon   
   he esteemeth iron as straw   and  brass as rotten wood   
   the arrow cannot make him flee  slingstones are turned with him into stubble   
   darts are counted as stubble  he laugheth at the shaking of a spear   
   sharp stones  are  under him  he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire   
   he maketh the deep to boil like a pot  he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment   
   he maketh a path to shine after him   one  would think the deep  to be  hoary   
   upon earth there is not his like  who is made without fear   
   he beholdeth all high  things   he  is  a king over all the children of pride   
job    
   then job answered the lord  and said   
  i know that thou canst do every  thing   and  that  no thought can be withholden from thee   
  who  is  he that hideth counsel without knowledge  therefore have i uttered that i understood not  things too wonderful for me  which i knew not   
  hear  i beseech thee  and i will speak  i will demand of thee  and declare thou unto me   
  i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear  but now mine eye seeth thee   
  wherefore i abhor  myself   and repent in dust and ashes   
   and it was  so   that after the lord had spoken these words unto job  the lord said to eliphaz the temanite  my wrath is kindled against thee  and against thy two friends  for ye have not spoken of me  the thing that is  right  as my servant job  hath    
  therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams  and go to my servant job  and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering  and my servant job shall pray for you  for him will i accept  lest i deal with you  after your  folly  in that ye have not spoken of me  the thing which is  right  like my servant job   
  so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite  and  zophar the naamathite went  and did according as the lord commanded them  the lord also accepted job   
    and the lord turned the captivity of job  when he prayed for his friends  also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before   
   then came there unto him all his brethren  and all his sisters  and all they that had been of his acquaintance before  and did eat bread with him in his house  and they bemoaned him  and comforted him over all the evil that the lord had brought upon him  every man also gave him a piece of money  and every one an earring of gold   
   so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning  for he had fourteen thousand sheep  and six thousand camels  and a thousand yoke of oxen  and a thousand she asses   
   he had also seven sons and three daughters   
   and he called the name of the first  jemima  and the name of the second  kezia  and the name of the third  kerenhappuch   
   and in all the land were no women found  so  fair as the daughters of job  and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren   
   after this lived job an hundred and forty years  and saw his sons  and his sons  sons   even  four generations   
   so job died   being  old and full of days   
 
psalms 
psalm   
   blessed  is  the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly  nor standeth in the way of sinners  nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful   
  but his delight  is  in the law of the lord  and in his law doth he meditate day and night   
  and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water  that bringeth forth his fruit in his season  his leaf also shall not wither  and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper   
   the ungodly  are  not so  but  are  like the chaff which the wind driveth away   
  therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment  nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous   
  for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous  but the way of the ungodly shall perish   
psalm   
   why do the heathen rage  and the people imagine a vain thing   
  the kings of the earth set themselves  and the rulers take counsel together  against the lord  and against his anointed   saying    
  let us break their bands asunder  and cast away their cords from us   
  he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh  the lord shall have them in derision   
  then shall he speak unto them in his wrath  and vex them in his sore displeasure   
  yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion   
   i will declare the decree  the lord hath said unto me  thou  art  my son  this day have i begotten thee   
  ask of me  and i shall give  thee  the heathen  for  thine inheritance  and the uttermost parts of the earth  for  thy possession   
  thou shalt break them with a rod of iron  thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter s vessel   
    be wise now therefore  o ye kings  be instructed  ye judges of the earth   
   serve the lord with fear  and rejoice with trembling   
   kiss the son  lest he be angry  and ye perish  from  the way  when his wrath is kindled but a little  blessed  are  all they that put their trust in him   
psalm   
   a psalm of david  when he fled from absalom his son  lord  how are they increased that trouble me  many  are  they that rise up against me   
  many  there be  which say of my soul   there is  no help for him in god  selah   
  but thou  o lord   art  a shield for me  my glory  and the lifter up of mine head   
   i cried unto the lord with my voice  and he heard me out of his holy hill  selah   
  i laid me down and slept  i awaked  for the lord sustained me   
  i will not be afraid of ten thousands of people  that have set  themselves  against me round about   
  arise  o lord  save me  o my god  for thou hast smitten all mine enemies  upon  the cheek bone  thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly   
  salvation  belongeth  unto the lord  thy blessing  is  upon thy people  selah   
psalm   
   to the chief musician on neginoth  a psalm of david  hear me when i call  o god of my righteousness  thou hast enlarged me  when i was  in distress  have mercy upon me  and hear my prayer   
  o ye sons of men  how long  will ye turn  my glory into shame   how long  will ye love vanity   and  seek after leasing  selah   
  but know that the lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself  the lord will hear when i call unto him   
  stand in awe  and sin not  commune with your own heart upon your bed  and be still  selah   
  offer the sacrifices of righteousness  and put your trust in the lord   
    there be  many that say  who will shew us  any  good  lord  lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us   
  thou hast put gladness in my heart  more than in the time  that  their corn and their wine increased   
  i will both lay me down in peace  and sleep  for thou  lord  only makest me dwell in safety   
psalm   
   to the chief musician upon nehiloth  a psalm of david  give ear to my words  o lord  consider my meditation   
  hearken unto the voice of my cry  my king  and my god  for unto thee will i pray   
  my voice shalt thou hear in the morning  o lord  in the morning will i direct  my prayer  unto thee  and will look up   
  for thou  art  not a god that hath pleasure in wickedness  neither shall evil dwell with thee   
  the foolish shall not stand in thy sight  thou hatest all workers of iniquity   
  thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing  the lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man   
   but as for me  i will come  into  thy house in the multitude of thy mercy   and  in thy fear will i worship toward thy holy temple   
  lead me  o lord  in thy righteousness because of mine enemies  make thy way straight before my face   
  for  there is  no faithfulness in their mouth  their inward part  is  very wickedness  their throat  is  an open sepulchre  they flatter with their tongue   
   destroy thou them  o god  let them fall by their own counsels  cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions  for they have rebelled against thee   
   but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice  let them ever shout for joy  because thou defendest them  let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee   
   for thou  lord  wilt bless the righteous  with favour wilt thou compass him as  with  a shield   
psalm   
   to the chief musician on neginoth upon sheminith  a psalm of david  o lord  rebuke me not in thine anger  neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure   
  have mercy upon me  o lord  for i  am  weak  o lord  heal me  for my bones are vexed   
  my soul is also sore vexed  but thou  o lord  how long   
  return  o lord  deliver my soul  oh save me for thy mercies  sake   
  for in death  there is  no remembrance of thee  in the grave who shall give thee thanks   
  i am weary with my groaning  all the night make i my bed to swim  i water my couch with my tears   
  mine eye is consumed because of grief  it waxeth old because of all mine enemies   
   depart from me  all ye workers of iniquity  for the lord hath heard the voice of my weeping   
  the lord hath heard my supplication  the lord will receive my prayer   
   let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed  let them return  and  be ashamed suddenly   
psalm   
   shiggaion of david  which he sang unto the lord  concerning the words of cush the benjamite  o lord my god  in thee do i put my trust  save me from all them that persecute me  and deliver me   
  lest he tear my soul like a lion  rending  it  in pieces  while  there is  none to deliver   
  o lord my god  if i have done this  if there be iniquity in my hands   
  if i have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me   yea  i have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy    
  let the enemy persecute my soul  and take  it   yea  let him tread down my life upon the earth  and lay mine honour in the dust  selah   
  arise  o lord  in thine anger  lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies  and awake for me  to  the judgment  that  thou hast commanded   
  so shall the congregation of the people compass thee about  for their sakes therefore return thou on high   
  the lord shall judge the people  judge me  o lord  according to my righteousness  and according to mine integrity  that is  in me   
  oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end  but establish the just  for the righteous god trieth the hearts and reins   
    my defence  is  of god  which saveth the upright in heart   
   god judgeth the righteous  and god is angry  with the wicked  every day   
   if he turn not  he will whet his sword  he hath bent his bow  and made it ready   
   he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death  he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors   
   behold  he travaileth with iniquity  and hath conceived mischief  and brought forth falsehood   
   he made a pit  and digged it  and is fallen into the ditch  which  he made   
   his mischief shall return upon his own head  and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate   
   i will praise the lord according to his righteousness  and will sing praise to the name of the lord most high   
psalm   
   to the chief musician upon gittith  a psalm of david  o lord our lord  how excellent  is  thy name in all the earth  who hast set thy glory above the heavens   
  out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies  that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger   
   when i consider thy heavens  the work of thy fingers  the moon and the stars  which thou hast ordained   
  what is man  that thou art mindful of him  and the son of man  that thou visitest him   
  for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels  and hast crowned him with glory and honour   
  thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands  thou hast put all  things  under his feet   
  all sheep and oxen  yea  and the beasts of the field   
  the fowl of the air  and the fish of the sea   and whatsoever  passeth through the paths of the seas   
  o lord our lord  how excellent  is  thy name in all the earth   
psalm   
   to the chief musician upon muthlabben  a psalm of david  i will praise  thee   o lord  with my whole heart  i will shew forth all thy marvellous works   
  i will be glad and rejoice in thee  i will sing praise to thy name  o thou most high   
  when mine enemies are turned back  they shall fall and perish at thy presence   
  for thou hast maintained my right and my cause  thou satest in the throne judging right   
  thou hast rebuked the heathen  thou hast destroyed the wicked  thou hast put out their name for ever and ever   
  o thou enemy  destructions are come to a perpetual end  and thou hast destroyed cities  their memorial is perished with them   
  but the lord shall endure for ever  he hath prepared his throne for judgment   
  and he shall judge the world in righteousness  he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness   
  the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed  a refuge in times of trouble   
   and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee  for thou  lord  hast not forsaken them that seek thee   
    sing praises to the lord  which dwelleth in zion  declare among the people his doings   
   when he maketh inquisition for blood  he remembereth them  he forgetteth not the cry of the humble   
   have mercy upon me  o lord  consider my trouble  which i suffer  of them that hate me  thou that liftest me up from the gates of death   
   that i may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of zion  i will rejoice in thy salvation   
   the heathen are sunk down in the pit  that  they made  in the net which they hid is their own foot taken   
   the lord is known  by  the judgment  which  he executeth  the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands  higgaion  selah   
   the wicked shall be turned into hell   and  all the nations that forget god   
   for the needy shall not alway be forgotten  the expectation of the poor shall  not  perish for ever   
   arise  o lord  let not man prevail  let the heathen be judged in thy sight   
   put them in fear  o lord   that  the nations may know themselves  to be but  men  selah   
psalm    
   why standest thou afar off  o lord   why  hidest thou  thyself  in times of trouble   
  the wicked in  his  pride doth persecute the poor  let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined   
  for the wicked boasteth of his heart s desire  and blesseth the covetous   whom  the lord abhorreth   
  the wicked  through the pride of his countenance  will not seek  after god   god  is  not in all his thoughts   
  his ways are always grievous  thy judgments  are  far above out of his sight   as for  all his enemies  he puffeth at them   
  he hath said in his heart  i shall not be moved  for  i shall  never  be  in adversity   
  his mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud  under his tongue  is  mischief and vanity   
  he sitteth in the lurking places of the villages  in the secret places doth he murder the innocent  his eyes are privily set against the poor   
  he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den  he lieth in wait to catch the poor  he doth catch the poor  when he draweth him into his net   
   he croucheth   and  humbleth himself  that the poor may fall by his strong ones   
   he hath said in his heart  god hath forgotten  he hideth his face  he will never see  it    
    arise  o lord  o god  lift up thine hand  forget not the humble   
   wherefore doth the wicked contemn god  he hath said in his heart  thou wilt not require  it    
   thou hast seen  it   for thou beholdest mischief and spite  to requite  it  with thy hand  the poor committeth himself unto thee  thou art the helper of the fatherless   
   break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil  man   seek out his wickedness  till  thou find none   
   the lord  is  king for ever and ever  the heathen are perished out of his land   
   lord  thou hast heard the desire of the humble  thou wilt prepare their heart  thou wilt cause thine ear to hear   
   to judge the fatherless and the oppressed  that the man of the earth may no more oppress   
psalm    
   to the chief musician   a psalm  of david  in the lord put i my trust  how say ye to my soul  flee  as  a bird to your mountain   
  for  lo  the wicked bend  their  bow  they make ready their arrow upon the string  that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart   
  if the foundations be destroyed  what can the righteous do   
   the lord  is  in his holy temple  the lord s throne  is  in heaven  his eyes behold  his eyelids try  the children of men   
  the lord trieth the righteous  but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth   
  upon the wicked he shall rain snares  fire and brimstone  and an horrible tempest   this shall be  the portion of their cup   
  for the righteous lord loveth righteousness  his countenance doth behold the upright   
psalm    
   to the chief musician upon sheminith  a psalm of david  help  lord  for the godly man ceaseth  for the faithful fail from among the children of men   
  they speak vanity every one with his neighbour   with  flattering lips  and  with a double heart do they speak   
  the lord shall cut off all flattering lips   and  the tongue that speaketh proud things   
  who have said  with our tongue will we prevail  our lips  are  our own  who  is  lord over us   
  for the oppression of the poor  for the sighing of the needy  now will i arise  saith the lord  i will set  him  in safety  from him that  puffeth at him   
  the words of the lord  are  pure words   as  silver tried in a furnace of earth  purified seven times   
  thou shalt keep them  o lord  thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever   
  the wicked walk on every side  when the vilest men are exalted   
psalm    
   to the chief musician  a psalm of david  how long wilt thou forget me  o lord  for ever  how long wilt thou hide thy face from me   
  how long shall i take counsel in my soul   having  sorrow in my heart daily  how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me   
  consider  and  hear me  o lord my god  lighten mine eyes  lest i sleep the  sleep of  death   
  lest mine enemy say  i have prevailed against him   and  those that trouble me rejoice when i am moved   
  but i have trusted in thy mercy  my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation   
  i will sing unto the lord  because he hath dealt bountifully with me   
psalm    
   to the chief musician   a psalm  of david  the fool hath said in his heart   there is  no god  they are corrupt  they have done abominable works   there is  none that doeth good   
  the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men  to see if there were any that did understand   and  seek god   
  they are all gone aside  they are  all  together become filthy   there is  none that doeth good  no  not one   
   have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge  who eat up my people  as  they eat bread  and call not upon the lord   
  there were they in great fear  for god  is  in the generation of the righteous   
  ye have shamed the counsel of the poor  because the lord  is  his refuge   
  oh that the salvation of israel  were come  out of zion  when the lord bringeth back the captivity of his people  jacob shall rejoice   and  israel shall be glad   
psalm    
   a psalm of david  lord  who shall abide in thy tabernacle  who shall dwell in thy holy hill   
  he that walketh uprightly  and worketh righteousness  and speaketh the truth in his heart   
   he that  backbiteth not with his tongue  nor doeth evil to his neighbour  nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour   
  in whose eyes a vile person is contemned  but he honoureth them that fear the lord   he that  sweareth to  his own  hurt  and changeth not   
   he that  putteth not out his money to usury  nor taketh reward against the innocent  he that doeth these  things  shall never be moved   
psalm    
   michtam of david  preserve me  o god  for in thee do i put my trust   
   o my soul   thou hast said unto the lord  thou  art  my lord  my goodness  extendeth  not to thee   
   but  to the saints that  are  in the earth  and  to  the excellent  in whom  is  all my delight   
  their sorrows shall be multiplied  that  hasten  after  another  god   their drink offerings of blood will i not offer  nor take up their names into my lips   
  the lord  is  the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup  thou maintainest my lot   
  the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant  places   yea  i have a goodly heritage   
  i will bless the lord  who hath given me counsel  my reins also instruct me in the night seasons   
   i have set the lord always before me  because  he is  at my right hand  i shall not be moved   
  therefore my heart is glad  and my glory rejoiceth  my flesh also shall rest in hope   
   for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell  neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption   
   thou wilt shew me the path of life  in thy presence  is  fulness of joy  at thy right hand  there are  pleasures for evermore   
psalm    
   a prayer of david  hear the right  o lord  attend unto my cry  give ear unto my prayer   that goeth  not out of feigned lips   
  let my sentence come forth from thy presence  let thine eyes behold the things that are equal   
  thou hast proved mine heart  thou hast visited  me  in the night  thou hast tried me   and  shalt find nothing  i am purposed  that  my mouth shall not transgress   
  concerning the works of men  by the word of thy lips i have kept  me from  the paths of the destroyer   
  hold up my goings in thy paths   that  my footsteps slip not   
  i have called upon thee  for thou wilt hear me  o god  incline thine ear unto me   and hear  my speech   
  shew thy marvellous lovingkindness  o thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust  in thee  from those that rise up  against them    
   keep me as the apple of the eye  hide me under the shadow of thy wings   
  from the wicked that oppress me   from  my deadly enemies   who  compass me about   
   they are inclosed in their own fat  with their mouth they speak proudly   
   they have now compassed us in our steps  they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth   
   like as a lion  that  is greedy of his prey  and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places   
   arise  o lord  disappoint him  cast him down  deliver my soul from the wicked   which is  thy sword   
   from men  which are  thy hand  o lord  from men of the world   which have  their portion in  this  life  and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid  treasure   they are full of children  and leave the rest of their  substance  to their babes   
   as for me  i will behold thy face in righteousness  i shall be satisfied  when i awake  with thy likeness   
psalm    
   to the chief musician   a psalm  of david  the servant of the lord  who spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day  that  the lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies  and from the hand of saul  and he said  i will love thee  o lord  my strength   
  the lord  is  my rock  and my fortress  and my deliverer  my god  my strength  in whom i will trust  my buckler  and the horn of my salvation   and  my high tower   
  i will call upon the lord   who is worthy  to be praised  so shall i be saved from mine enemies   
  the sorrows of death compassed me  and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid   
  the sorrows of hell compassed me about  the snares of death prevented me   
  in my distress i called upon the lord  and cried unto my god  he heard my voice out of his temple  and my cry came before him   even  into his ears   
  then the earth shook and trembled  the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken  because he was wroth   
  there went up a smoke out of his nostrils  and fire out of his mouth devoured  coals were kindled by it   
  he bowed the heavens also  and came down  and darkness  was  under his feet   
   and he rode upon a cherub  and did fly  yea  he did fly upon the wings of the wind   
   he made darkness his secret place  his pavilion round about him  were  dark waters  and  thick clouds of the skies   
   at the brightness  that was  before him his thick clouds passed  hail  stones  and coals of fire   
   the lord also thundered in the heavens  and the highest gave his voice  hail  stones  and coals of fire   
   yea  he sent out his arrows  and scattered them  and he shot out lightnings  and discomfited them   
   then the channels of waters were seen  and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke  o lord  at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils   
   he sent from above  he took me  he drew me out of many waters   
   he delivered me from my strong enemy  and from them which hated me  for they were too strong for me   
   they prevented me in the day of my calamity  but the lord was my stay   
   he brought me forth also into a large place  he delivered me  because he delighted in me   
    the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness  according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me   
   for i have kept the ways of the lord  and have not wickedly departed from my god   
   for all his judgments  were  before me  and i did not put away his statutes from me   
   i was also upright before him  and i kept myself from mine iniquity   
   therefore hath the lord recompensed me according to my righteousness  according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight   
   with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful  with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright   
   with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure  and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward   
   for thou wilt save the afflicted people  but wilt bring down high looks   
   for thou wilt light my candle  the lord my god will enlighten my darkness   
    for by thee i have run through a troop  and by my god have i leaped over a wall   
    as for  god  his way  is  perfect  the word of the lord is tried  he  is  a buckler to all those that trust in him   
   for who  is  god save the lord  or who  is  a rock save our god   
    it is  god that girdeth me with strength  and maketh my way perfect   
   he maketh my feet like hinds   feet   and setteth me upon my high places   
   he teacheth my hands to war  so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms   
   thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation  and thy right hand hath holden me up  and thy gentleness hath made me great   
   thou hast enlarged my steps under me  that my feet did not slip   
   i have pursued mine enemies  and overtaken them  neither did i turn again till they were consumed   
   i have wounded them that they were not able to rise  they are fallen under my feet   
   for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle  thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me   
   thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies  that i might destroy them that hate me   
   they cried  but  there was  none to save  them  even  unto the lord  but he answered them not   
   then did i beat them small as the dust before the wind  i did cast them out as the dirt in the streets   
   thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people   and  thou hast made me the head of the heathen  a people  whom  i have not known shall serve me   
   as soon as they hear of me  they shall obey me  the strangers shall submit themselves unto me   
   the strangers shall fade away  and be afraid out of their close places   
   the lord liveth  and blessed  be  my rock  and let the god of my salvation be exalted   
    it is  god that avengeth me  and subdueth the people under me   
   he delivereth me from mine enemies  yea  thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me  thou hast delivered me from the violent man   
   therefore will i give thanks unto thee  o lord  among the heathen  and sing praises unto thy name   
   great deliverance giveth he to his king  and sheweth mercy to his anointed  to david  and to his seed for evermore   
psalm    
   to the chief musician  a psalm of david  the heavens declare the glory of god  and the firmament sheweth his handywork   
  day unto day uttereth speech  and night unto night sheweth knowledge   
   there is  no speech nor language   where  their voice is not heard   
  their line is gone out through all the earth  and their words to the end of the world  in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun   
  which  is  as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber   and  rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race   
  his going forth  is  from the end of the heaven  and his circuit unto the ends of it  and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof   
   the law of the lord  is  perfect  converting the soul  the testimony of the lord  is  sure  making wise the simple   
  the statutes of the lord  are  right  rejoicing the heart  the commandment of the lord  is  pure  enlightening the eyes   
  the fear of the lord  is  clean  enduring for ever  the judgments of the lord  are  true  and  righteous altogether   
   more to be desired  are they  than gold  yea  than much fine gold  sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb   
   moreover by them is thy servant warned   and  in keeping of them  there is  great reward   
   who can understand  his  errors  cleanse thou me from secret  faults    
   keep back thy servant also from presumptuous  sins   let them not have dominion over me  then shall i be upright  and i shall be innocent from the great transgression   
   let the words of my mouth  and the meditation of my heart  be acceptable in thy sight  o lord  my strength  and my redeemer   
psalm    
   to the chief musician  a psalm of david  the lord hear thee in the day of trouble  the name of the god of jacob defend thee   
  send thee help from the sanctuary  and strengthen thee out of zion   
  remember all thy offerings  and accept thy burnt sacrifice  selah   
  grant thee according to thine own heart  and fulfil all thy counsel   
  we will rejoice in thy salvation  and in the name of our god we will set up  our  banners  the lord fulfil all thy petitions   
   now know i that the lord saveth his anointed  he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand   
  some  trust  in chariots  and some in horses  but we will remember the name of the lord our god   
  they are brought down and fallen  but we are risen  and stand upright   
  save  lord  let the king hear us when we call   
psalm    
   to the chief musician  a psalm of david  the king shall joy in thy strength  o lord  and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice   
  thou hast given him his heart s desire  and hast not withholden the request of his lips  selah   
  for thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness  thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head   
  he asked life of thee   and  thou gavest  it  him   even  length of days for ever and ever   
  his glory  is  great in thy salvation  honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him   
  for thou hast made him most blessed for ever  thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance   
   for the king trusteth in the lord  and through the mercy of the most high he shall not be moved   
  thine hand shall find out all thine enemies  thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee   
  thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger  the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath  and the fire shall devour them   
   their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth  and their seed from among the children of men   
   for they intended evil against thee  they imagined a mischievous device   which  they are not able  to perform    
   therefore shalt thou make them turn their back   when  thou shalt make ready  thine arrows  upon thy strings against the face of them   
   be thou exalted  lord  in thine own strength   so  will we sing and praise thy power   
psalm    
   to the chief musician upon aijeleth shahar  a psalm of david  my god  my god  why hast thou forsaken me   why art thou so  far from helping me   and from  the words of my roaring   
  o my god  i cry in the daytime  but thou hearest not  and in the night season  and am not silent   
  but thou  art  holy   o thou  that inhabitest the praises of israel   
  our fathers trusted in thee  they trusted  and thou didst deliver them   
  they cried unto thee  and were delivered  they trusted in thee  and were not confounded   
  but i  am  a worm  and no man  a reproach of men  and despised of the people   
  all they that see me laugh me to scorn  they shoot out the lip  they shake the head   saying    
  he trusted on the lord  that  he would deliver him  let him deliver him  seeing he delighted in him   
  but thou  art  he that took me out of the womb  thou didst make me hope  when i was  upon my mother s breasts   
   i was cast upon thee from the womb  thou  art  my god from my mother s belly   
    be not far from me  for trouble  is  near  for  there is  none to help   
   many bulls have compassed me  strong  bulls  of bashan have beset me round   
   they gaped upon me  with  their mouths   as  a ravening and a roaring lion   
   i am poured out like water  and all my bones are out of joint  my heart is like wax  it is melted in the midst of my bowels   
   my strength is dried up like a potsherd  and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws  and thou hast brought me into the dust of death   
   for dogs have compassed me  the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me  they pierced my hands and my feet   
   i may tell all my bones  they look  and  stare upon me   
   they part my garments among them  and cast lots upon my vesture   
   but be not thou far from me  o lord  o my strength  haste thee to help me   
   deliver my soul from the sword  my darling from the power of the dog   
   save me from the lion s mouth  for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns   
    i will declare thy name unto my brethren  in the midst of the congregation will i praise thee   
   ye that fear the lord  praise him  all ye the seed of jacob  glorify him  and fear him  all ye the seed of israel   
   for he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted  neither hath he hid his face from him  but when he cried unto him  he heard   
   my praise  shall be  of thee in the great congregation  i will pay my vows before them that fear him   
   the meek shall eat and be satisfied  they shall praise the lord that seek him  your heart shall live for ever   
   all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord  and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee   
   for the kingdom  is  the lord s  and he  is  the governor among the nations   
   all  they that be  fat upon earth shall eat and worship  all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him  and none can keep alive his own soul   
   a seed shall serve him  it shall be accounted to the lord for a generation   
   they shall come  and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born  that he hath done  this    
psalm    
   a psalm of david  the lord  is  my shepherd  i shall not want   
  he maketh me to lie down in green pastures  he leadeth me beside the still waters   
  he restoreth my soul  he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name s sake   
  yea  though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death  i will fear no evil  for thou  art  with me  thy rod and thy staff they comfort me   
  thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies  thou anointest my head with oil  my cup runneth over   
  surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life  and i will dwell in the house of the lord for ever   
psalm    
   a psalm of david  the earth  is  the lord s  and the fulness thereof  the world  and they that dwell therein   
  for he hath founded it upon the seas  and established it upon the floods   
   who shall ascend into the hill of the lord  or who shall stand in his holy place   
  he that hath clean hands  and a pure heart  who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity  nor sworn deceitfully   
  he shall receive the blessing from the lord  and righteousness from the god of his salvation   
  this  is  the generation of them that seek him  that seek thy face  o jacob  selah   
   lift up your heads  o ye gates  and be ye lift up  ye everlasting doors  and the king of glory shall come in   
  who  is  this king of glory  the lord strong and mighty  the lord mighty in battle   
  lift up your heads  o ye gates  even lift  them  up  ye everlasting doors  and the king of glory shall come in   
   who is this king of glory  the lord of hosts  he  is  the king of glory  selah   
psalm    
    a psalm  of david  unto thee  o lord  do i lift up my soul   
  o my god  i trust in thee  let me not be ashamed  let not mine enemies triumph over me   
  yea  let none that wait on thee be ashamed  let them be ashamed which transgress without cause   
  shew me thy ways  o lord  teach me thy paths   
  lead me in thy truth  and teach me  for thou  art  the god of my salvation  on thee do i wait all the day   
  remember  o lord  thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses  for they  have been  ever of old   
  remember not the sins of my youth  nor my transgressions  according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness  sake  o lord   
   good and upright  is  the lord  therefore will he teach sinners in the way   
  the meek will he guide in judgment  and the meek will he teach his way   
   all the paths of the lord  are  mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies   
   for thy name s sake  o lord  pardon mine iniquity  for it  is  great   
   what man  is  he that feareth the lord  him shall he teach in the way  that  he shall choose   
   his soul shall dwell at ease  and his seed shall inherit the earth   
   the secret of the lord  is  with them that fear him  and he will shew them his covenant   
    mine eyes  are  ever toward the lord  for he shall pluck my feet out of the net   
   turn thee unto me  and have mercy upon me  for i  am  desolate and afflicted   
   the troubles of my heart are enlarged   o  bring thou me out of my distresses   
   look upon mine affliction and my pain  and forgive all my sins   
   consider mine enemies  for they are many  and they hate me with cruel hatred   
   o keep my soul  and deliver me  let me not be ashamed  for i put my trust in thee   
   let integrity and uprightness preserve me  for i wait on thee   
   redeem israel  o god  out of all his troubles   
psalm    
    a psalm  of david  judge me  o lord  for i have walked in mine integrity  i have trusted also in the lord   therefore  i shall not slide   
  examine me  o lord  and prove me  try my reins and my heart   
  for thy lovingkindness  is  before mine eyes  and i have walked in thy truth   
  i have not sat with vain persons  neither will i go in with dissemblers   
  i have hated the congregation of evil doers  and will not sit with the wicked   
   i will wash mine hands in innocency  so will i compass thine altar  o lord   
  that i may publish with the voice of thanksgiving  and tell of all thy wondrous works   
  lord  i have loved the habitation of thy house  and the place where thine honour dwelleth   
  gather not my soul with sinners  nor my life with bloody men   
   in whose hands  is  mischief  and their right hand is full of bribes   
   but as for me  i will walk in mine integrity  redeem me  and be merciful unto me   
   my foot standeth in an even place  in the congregations will i bless the lord   
psalm    
    a psalm  of david  the lord  is  my light and my salvation  whom shall i fear  the lord  is  the strength of my life  of whom shall i be afraid   
  when the wicked   even  mine enemies and my foes  came upon me to eat up my flesh  they stumbled and fell   
  though an host should encamp against me  my heart shall not fear  though war should rise against me  in this  will  i  be  confident   
  one  thing  have i desired of the lord  that will i seek after  that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life  to behold the beauty of the lord  and to enquire in his temple   
  for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion  in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me  he shall set me up upon a rock   
  and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me  therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy  i will sing  yea  i will sing praises unto the lord   
   hear  o lord   when  i cry with my voice  have mercy also upon me  and answer me   
   when thou saidst   seek ye my face  my heart said unto thee  thy face  lord  will i seek   
  hide not thy face  far  from me  put not thy servant away in anger  thou hast been my help  leave me not  neither forsake me  o god of my salvation   
   when my father and my mother forsake me  then the lord will take me up   
   teach me thy way  o lord  and lead me in a plain path  because of mine enemies   
   deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies  for false witnesses are risen up against me  and such as breathe out cruelty   
    i had fainted   unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living   
   wait on the lord  be of good courage  and he shall strengthen thine heart  wait  i say  on the lord   
psalm    
    a psalm  of david  unto thee will i cry  o lord my rock  be not silent to me  lest   if  thou be silent to me  i become like them that go down into the pit   
  hear the voice of my supplications  when i cry unto thee  when i lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle   
  draw me not away with the wicked  and with the workers of iniquity  which speak peace to their neighbours  but mischief  is  in their hearts   
  give them according to their deeds  and according to the wickedness of their endeavours  give them after the work of their hands  render to them their desert   
  because they regard not the works of the lord  nor the operation of his hands  he shall destroy them  and not build them up   
   blessed  be  the lord  because he hath heard the voice of my supplications   
  the lord  is  my strength and my shield  my heart trusted in him  and i am helped  therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth  and with my song will i praise him   
  the lord  is  their strength  and he  is  the saving strength of his anointed   
  save thy people  and bless thine inheritance  feed them also  and lift them up for ever   
psalm    
   a psalm of david  give unto the lord  o ye mighty  give unto the lord glory and strength   
  give unto the lord the glory due unto his name  worship the lord in the beauty of holiness   
  the voice of the lord  is  upon the waters  the god of glory thundereth  the lord  is  upon many waters   
  the voice of the lord  is  powerful  the voice of the lord  is  full of majesty   
  the voice of the lord breaketh the cedars  yea  the lord breaketh the cedars of lebanon   
  he maketh them also to skip like a calf  lebanon and sirion like a young unicorn   
  the voice of the lord divideth the flames of fire   
  the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness  the lord shaketh the wilderness of kadesh   
  the voice of the lord maketh the hinds to calve  and discovereth the forests  and in his temple doth every one speak of  his  glory   
   the lord sitteth upon the flood  yea  the lord sitteth king for ever   
   the lord will give strength unto his people  the lord will bless his people with peace   
psalm    
   a psalm  and  song  at  the dedication of the house of david  i will extol thee  o lord  for thou hast lifted me up  and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me   
  o lord my god  i cried unto thee  and thou hast healed me   
  o lord  thou hast brought up my soul from the grave  thou hast kept me alive  that i should not go down to the pit   
  sing unto the lord  o ye saints of his  and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness   
  for his anger  endureth but  a moment  in his favour  is  life  weeping may endure for a night  but joy  cometh  in the morning   
   and in my prosperity i said  i shall never be moved   
  lord  by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong  thou didst hide thy face   and  i was troubled   
  i cried to thee  o lord  and unto the lord i made supplication   
  what profit  is there  in my blood  when i go down to the pit  shall the dust praise thee  shall it declare thy truth   
   hear  o lord  and have mercy upon me  lord  be thou my helper   
   thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing  thou hast put off my sackcloth  and girded me with gladness   
   to the end that  my  glory may sing praise to thee  and not be silent  o lord my god  i will give thanks unto thee for ever   
psalm    
   to the chief musician  a psalm of david  in thee  o lord  do i put my trust  let me never be ashamed  deliver me in thy righteousness   
  bow down thine ear to me  deliver me speedily  be thou my strong rock  for an house of defence to save me   
  for thou  art  my rock and my fortress  therefore for thy name s sake lead me  and guide me   
  pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me  for thou  art  my strength   
  into thine hand i commit my spirit  thou hast redeemed me  o lord god of truth   
  i have hated them that regard lying vanities  but i trust in the lord   
  i will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy  for thou hast considered my trouble  thou hast known my soul in adversities   
  and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy  thou hast set my feet in a large room   
   have mercy upon me  o lord  for i am in trouble  mine eye is consumed with grief   yea   my soul and my belly   
   for my life is spent with grief  and my years with sighing  my strength faileth because of mine iniquity  and my bones are consumed   
   i was a reproach among all mine enemies  but especially among my neighbours  and a fear to mine acquaintance  they that did see me without fled from me   
   i am forgotten as a dead man out of mind  i am like a broken vessel   
   for i have heard the slander of many  fear  was  on every side  while they took counsel together against me  they devised to take away my life   
   but i trusted in thee  o lord  i said  thou  art  my god   
   my times  are  in thy hand  deliver me from the hand of mine enemies  and from them that persecute me   
   make thy face to shine upon thy servant  save me for thy mercies  sake   
   let me not be ashamed  o lord  for i have called upon thee  let the wicked be ashamed   and  let them be silent in the grave   
   let the lying lips be put to silence  which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous   
     oh  how great  is  thy goodness  which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee   which  thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men   
   thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man  thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues   
   blessed  be  the lord  for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city   
   for i said in my haste  i am cut off from before thine eyes  nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when i cried unto thee   
   o love the lord  all ye his saints   for  the lord preserveth the faithful  and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer   
   be of good courage  and he shall strengthen your heart  all ye that hope in the lord   
psalm    
    a psalm  of david  maschil  blessed  is he whose  transgression  is  forgiven   whose  sin  is  covered   
  blessed  is  the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity  and in whose spirit  there is  no guile

   thou  art  my hiding place  thou shalt preserve me from trouble  thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance  selah   
  i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go  i will guide thee with mine eye   
  be ye not as the horse   or  as the mule   which  have no understanding  whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle  lest they come near unto thee   
   many sorrows  shall be  to the wicked  but he that trusteth in the lord  mercy shall compass him about   
   be glad in the lord  and rejoice  ye righteous  and shout for joy  all  ye that are  upright in heart   
psalm    
   rejoice in the lord  o ye righteous   for  praise is comely for the upright   
  praise the lord with harp  sing unto him with the psaltery  and  an instrument of ten strings   
  sing unto him a new song  play skilfully with a loud noise   
  for the word of the lord  is  right  and all his works  are done  in truth   
  he loveth righteousness and judgment  the earth is full of the goodness of the lord   
  by the word of the lord were the heavens made  and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth   
  he gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap  he layeth up the depth in storehouses   
  let all the earth fear the lord  let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him   
  for he spake  and it was  done   he commanded  and it stood fast   
   the lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought  he maketh the devices of the people of none effect   
   the counsel of the lord standeth for ever  the thoughts of his heart to all generations   
    blessed  is  the nation whose god  is  the lord   and  the people  whom  he hath chosen for his own inheritance   
   the lord looketh from heaven  he beholdeth all the sons of men   
   from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth   
   he fashioneth their hearts alike  he considereth all their works   
   there is no king saved by the multitude of an host  a mighty man is not delivered by much strength   
   an horse  is  a vain thing for safety  neither shall he deliver  any  by his great strength   
   behold  the eye of the lord  is  upon them that fear him  upon them that hope in his mercy   
   to deliver their soul from death  and to keep them alive in famine   
   our soul waiteth for the lord  he  is  our help and our shield   
   for our heart shall rejoice in him  because we have trusted in his holy name   
   let thy mercy  o lord  be upon us  according as we hope in thee   
psalm    
    a psalm  of david  when he changed his behaviour before abimelech  who drove him away  and he departed  i will bless the lord at all times  his praise  shall  continually  be  in my mouth   
  my soul shall make her boast in the lord  the humble shall hear  thereof   and be glad   
  o magnify the lord with me  and let us exalt his name together   
  i sought the lord  and he heard me  and delivered me from all my fears   
  they looked unto him  and were lightened  and their faces were not ashamed   
  this poor man cried  and the lord heard  him   and saved him out of all his troubles   
  the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him  and delivereth them   
  o taste and see that the lord  is  good  blessed  is  the man  that  trusteth in him   
  o fear the lord  ye his saints  for  there is  no want to them that fear him   
   the young lions do lack  and suffer hunger  but they that seek the lord shall not want any good  thing    
    come  ye children  hearken unto me  i will teach you the fear of the lord   
   what man  is he that  desireth life   and  loveth  many  days  that he may see good   
   keep thy tongue from evil  and thy lips from speaking guile   
   depart from evil  and do good  seek peace  and pursue it   
   the eyes of the lord  are  upon the righteous  and his ears  are open  unto their cry   
   the face of the lord  is  against them that do evil  to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth   
    the righteous  cry  and the lord heareth  and delivereth them out of all their troubles   
   the lord  is  nigh unto them that are of a broken heart  and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit   
   many  are  the afflictions of the righteous  but the lord delivereth him out of them all   
   he keepeth all his bones  not one of them is broken   
   evil shall slay the wicked  and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate   
   the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants  and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate   
psalm    
    a psalm  of david  plead  my cause   o lord  with them that strive with me  fight against them that fight against me   
  take hold of shield and buckler  and stand up for mine help   
  draw out also the spear  and stop  the way  against them that persecute me  say unto my soul  i  am  thy salvation   
  let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul  let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt   
  let them be as chaff before the wind  and let the angel of the lord chase  them    
  let their way be dark and slippery  and let the angel of the lord persecute them   
  for without cause have they hid for me their net  in  a pit   which  without cause they have digged for my soul   
  let destruction come upon him at unawares  and let his net that he hath hid catch himself  into that very destruction let him fall   
  and my soul shall be joyful in the lord  it shall rejoice in his salvation   
   all my bones shall say  lord  who  is  like unto thee  which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him  yea  the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him   
    false witnesses did rise up  they laid to my charge  things  that i knew not   
   they rewarded me evil for good  to  the spoiling of my soul   
   but as for me  when they were sick  my clothing  was  sackcloth  i humbled my soul with fasting  and my prayer returned into mine own bosom   
   i behaved myself as though  he had been  my friend  or  brother  i bowed down heavily  as one that mourneth  for his  mother   
   but in mine adversity they rejoiced  and gathered themselves together   yea   the abjects gathered themselves together against me  and i knew  it  not  they did tear  me   and ceased not   
   with hypocritical mockers in feasts  they gnashed upon me with their teeth   
    lord  how long wilt thou look on  rescue my soul from their destructions  my darling from the lions   
   i will give thee thanks in the great congregation  i will praise thee among much people   
   let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me   neither  let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause   
   for they speak not peace  but they devise deceitful matters against  them that are  quiet in the land   
   yea  they opened their mouth wide against me   and  said  aha  aha  our eye hath seen  it    
    this  thou hast seen  o lord  keep not silence  o lord  be not far from me   
   stir up thyself  and awake to my judgment   even  unto my cause  my god and my lord   
   judge me  o lord my god  according to thy righteousness  and let them not rejoice over me   
   let them not say in their hearts  ah  so would we have it  let them not say  we have swallowed him up   
   let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt  let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify  themselves  against me   
   let them shout for joy  and be glad  that favour my righteous cause  yea  let them say continually  let the lord be magnified  which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant   
   and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness  and  of thy praise all the day long   
psalm    
   to the chief musician   a psalm  of david the servant of the lord  the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart   that there is  no fear of god before his eyes   
  for he flattereth himself in his own eyes  until his iniquity be found to be hateful   
  the words of his mouth  are  iniquity and deceit  he hath left off to be wise   and  to do good   
  he deviseth mischief upon his bed  he setteth himself in a way  that is  not good  he abhorreth not evil   
   thy mercy  o lord   is  in the heavens   and  thy faithfulness  reacheth  unto the clouds   
  thy righteousness  is  like the great mountains  thy judgments  are  a great deep  o lord  thou preservest man and beast
